    <p>A change to the major version indicates a significant change to the way the API works, and a few of the changes Brightcove made to simplify the API could break some integration code. Because of this, and in order to prevent problems with your site, automatic updates will not be made for major version updates. That means that your player will effectively be locked at the final release of Brightcove Player version 5, even if you have selected automatic update mode. This means you will need to manually update to Brightcove Player 6 once your testing is complete.</p>
