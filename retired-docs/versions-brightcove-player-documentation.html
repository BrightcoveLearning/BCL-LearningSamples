    <p>The Brightcove Player documentation contains two versions of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the Brightcove Player with a Video Cloud account</li>
      <li>Using the Brightcove Player in standalone (Perform) mode (with content from some other source)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that the great majority of the content is identical for both versions, so you may not see anything visibly change when you switch to the other version.</aside>
    <p>It is the same player in either case, but if you have a Video Cloud account, the player is able to pull the locations of videos and assets directly from Video Cloud, so that you don't have to provide that information manually.</p>
    <p>Where this makes a difference, we have created alternate versions of the content for each scenario, and you should choose the version according to which scenario fits your situation.</p>
    <p>You can switch back and forth between the Video Cloud and standalone Player versions of the document using the buttons that appear at the top right of the page.</p>
