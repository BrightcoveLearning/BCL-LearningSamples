  <h1>Deep Linking</h1>
  <p>
    Deep linking is a feature that allows a user to start viewing a video from a specific time offset.
    This is a very useful feature for sharing a video like a newscast, where the user may want people to view a certain segment of the program without having to watch everything that precedes it.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    Although native players such as Windows Media Player, Flash Player, and Quicktime support deep linking through different mechanisms,
    this behavior is not directly exposed through the HTML <code>video</code> or <code>source</code> elements.
    It is, however, indirectly exposed through the <code>currentTime</code> property of the <code>video</code> element.
    This effectively allows HTML players like videojs and YouTube to layer deep linking support on top of native video players.
  </p>

  <h2>Support in Social Services</h2>
  <p>
    As we learned above, HTML players can support deep linking, but this necessitates that the player be either embedded in the page, or included as an <code>iframe</code>.
    Unfortunately, most social services do not follow this practice, and instead substitute a native player which does not support deep linking.
    As of July 1st, 2014 only one major social network, Twitter, supports direct inclusion of the videojs player in the social feed using an iframe, making deep linking possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Specifying Deep Linking</h2>
  <p>
    To specify a deep link in the videojs player the YouTube offset format is used.
    It follows the format: 00h00m00s, where each of the 3 parts represents a different unit of time (hours, minutes, seconds).
    Each of the parts must be present, so to go to offset 30 seconds, you would write:  0h0m315s.
    This is then added as a named bookmark at the end of the query string, as in: <code>#t=0h0m15s</code>.<br/>
    An example of a deep link to a video is as follows:<br/>
