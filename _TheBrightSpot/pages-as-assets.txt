Adding Pages to Playlists

You can now create secondary pages and add them to playlists. This gives you the option to have an asset in a playlist that when clicked shows a new page.

The functionality of adding pages to playlists permits you to create a thumbnail in a playlist that when clicked opens a new page. For instance, say you have 20 playlists that fit under an Outdoor Adventures page, but you don't want that many carousels on a single page. Using secondary pages you can group the 20 videos into separate secondary pages then add the secondary pages to the Outdoor Adventures page. 

The two thumbnails in the following screenshot from a Beacon app actually open new pages.
