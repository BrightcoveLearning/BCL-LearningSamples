*Getting Started - Contain documents that provide a basis on which to begin your journey of building your Brightcove Beacon apps. 

The key documents are the Learning Guide and Implementation phases.

The Learning Guide introduces you to 
  -What Brightcove Beacon is
  -What information and assets you as customers need to provide
  -The major phases of implementing a Brightcove Beacon solution
  -How device apps are updated, and key feature and strength of Brightcove Beacon

This doc can be especially helpful to your team members that are new to the Brightcove Beacon project.

Why Getting started still relevant,
1. New employees
2. Implementors not always the deciders
