**Opening slide

**Slide 2
Brightcove Beacon's video assets are stored in Video Cloud. In most cases the videos will have custome fields of metadata associated with them that is critical to the proper functioning and use of the videos within Brightcove Beacon. In this video I will be helping you learn the following:
1. What are the general grouping of custom fields used in Brightcove Beacon?
2. What custom fields need to be created for Brightcove Beacon?
3. How do you populate the custom fields with meaningful data?

**Slide 3
It is instructive to understand the types of custom fields Brightcove Beacon uses from Video Cloud. It will help us better understand how to provide values for the fields.

**Slide 4
The custom fields for Brightcove Beacon are placed into three groups, those being:
1. General custom fields which hold, surprise, general information about the video like cast, music, director, etc. These fields are created once and then you can provide values corresponding to each video.
2. Rights management fields support monetization and access restrictions. So if you want to show a pre-roll and mid-roll advertisements in a video it can be done via these fields. Also, if you have a special set of holiday videos, you could set when the videos would be available. These fields are created as related groups via a counter system, which we will see in action later.
3. Episode Fields assign a video that is an episode of a series to the correct series and season of that series. Like the general fields, they are created once and you can then assign values for each individual episode.

**Slide 5
Now we are ready to see all the fields and how to sue them 

**Slide 6, 7, 8
Rather than look strictly at these three slides, lets go and look at the doc that has been referenced so many times, and also the actual UIs

**Create video fields doc
There are lots of these fields, so we need a reference. That reference is the Creating Video Cloud Custom Fields document.  Let's take a look at this in some more detail.

Note that the doc starts with info creating custom fields, and a discussion on standard Video Cloud fields, both of which are topics of earlier videos in this course series.

We'll scroll down to the  custom field names section. This section lets us know that a custom field has both a display name and an internal name. We can choose the display name, but the internal name MUST match what we will see in the doc.

Next we see the general custom fields. Not surprisingly, they represent general information about a video asset. Note that there are short and long description fields, that if given values, will override the values entered in the videos properties page in Studio.

Now onto the rights management fields. 

These fields support the monetization and access restrictions for the video assets. As opposed to other custom fields, these fields work together in groups. There is a counter needed for each group. In the screenshot, we see the first group has 0 as the counter and the second group has 1 as a counter.

We see in these two sets, the rights management custom fields specify when, where and what devices would be able to see a video to which these fields are given values. In addition, the next screenshot shows the implementation of server-side ad insertion (SSAI) for a Video Cloud video. Note that in this case, only the beacon.rights.<counter>.adConfiguration and beacon.rights.<counter>.type are used.

And finally, the last group of custom fields are for episodes. The screenshot shows the relationship of series/seasons/episodes. And then we see values that would be assigned. Finally we see a screenshot the actual values assigned to the custom fields for a specific video.

It is instructive to understand that the information on the series and seasons entities are created in the the Brightcove Beacon UI, whereas the episode video is then ingested into Brightcove Beacon. As expected, custom field values assign the episode to the correct series and season.

Lastly, we see there are only three custom fields associated with episode videos.

**Slide 7
We have seen that custom fields are critical to successfully using Video Cloud videos in Brightcove Beacon. Let's look at the relatively simple process of creating the custom fields.

**Slide 8
We create custom fields back in the ADMIN â†’ video fields screen, so lets get there.

**Admin custom fields
And to no one's surprise, we'll click the ADD CUSTOM FIELD button.

Give the custom field a name from the tables in the doc. Note that we can change the display name, but the Internal name MUST be as shown as in the tables.

The data type defines if we have a free form text field or a list. The list is a dropdown box from which we can select a value. Note that if we use a list, only one value can be selected when assigning data.

Descriptions are optional, and no custom fields for Brightcove Beacon should be marked required.

If we change the data type to LIST, the UI changes. We can enter list values as comma separated, or one at a time, or both.

And that is how custom fields are created.

**Change to  custom field doc
Note that at the top of the custom fields document are the steps to create a custom field, along with details about custom fields like number of characters allowed and how to edit lists.

**Slide 9
Here are some details about managing custom fields
1. As mentioned, the internal names must match what is in the tables.
2. Once a custom field is created, we cannot edit or remove it. If we make a typo, just create a new, correct field. Brightcove support can be asked to remove the incorrect custom field.

**Slide 10
Well, the fun's over. We are sadly to the last slide.

To review:
*Some of the standard Video Cloud video fields are used by Brightcove Beacon, including the descriptions, time range,  and image fields.
*Some custom video fields MUST be created to ingest video assets into Brightcove Beacon successfully. As we've seen, the custom fields document we have been looking through is essential for successful custom field implementation.
*If we want even more information on custom fields (it is exciting), check out the Creating Custom Metadata Fields video and document from our Studio documentation. The link to both of those documents are in the document from which you played this video.

Thanks much, and have fun with Brightcove Beacon.
