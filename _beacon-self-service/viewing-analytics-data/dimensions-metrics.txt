**Opening 
The previous video in this course was mostly about learning how to view the Brightcove supplied Google Analytics dashboard and report. 

In this video, you will learn about the Brightcove supplied dimensions and metric.

**Slide 2
Brightcove supplies some dimensions and one metric in our Google Analytics account. 

So, we should probably understand what exactly analytics dimensions and metrics are before we try to use them.

To utilize these dimensions and metric we need to know which ones are available, so we'll see where they are located in the Google Analytics UI.

And lastly, we use some of the dimensions and the one metric in reports.

**Slide 3
We'll jump in first learning what dimensions and metrics are, then where we can see the Brightcove supplied ones.

**Slide 4
Basically, a dimension is an attribute of our data.

For instance, the city where a viewer is watching from is an example of a dimension, and that dimension can have many values.

The metric is a qualitative measurement on that dimension.

The number of sessions from a particular city would be the metric.

Another dimension could be browser

Browser, of course, could have multiple values, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, whatever it is.

Then the metric would be the count of the people that visited with each browser.

80% of the people were using Safari, 15% using Chrome, etc.

That's a quick view of what dimensions and metrics are.

**Slide 5
By default, Google supplies numerous dimensions and metrics. 

Brightcove felt that customers would want a few more added that would be particularly helpful for Brightcove Beacon, for instance, the metric Time Watched for videos.

The slide details the navigation to see these custom dimensions and the single metric. 

We'll go in and look at those in just a moment.

**Slide 6
Note that not all the dimensions are the same for each platform. 

Here we see the 16 dimensions for iOS and the 20 dimensions for web.

Lets go see where these dimensions and metric can be viewed.

**WEB Google Analytics
Go back to Analytics, Admin, custom definitions, Custom Dimensions, PAUSE and here's the custom Dimensions for web. There are 20 of them.

Let's change the view to iOS, PAUSE and there are 16 here.

Custom metrics are just one, and that's time watched.

And these are the added tools we have to use.

**Slide 7
The next logical question is, how we can use these dimensions and metic? 

Letâ€™s take a quick look.

**Slide 8
Again, this is not a course on Google Analytics. 

This is just giving us a peek into using what's been supplied to us, and what we can do with them.

What we want to do is build a report that uses genre, which is a custom dimension, and time watched, which is the custom metric.

Let's go and do that.

**WEB Google Analytics
We'll start by first clicking customization then customer Reports.

Next a new custom report.

For the title, ReportDemo

For the name, Genre by Time Watched

Here we're going to add a metric.

And the metric we want to use is actually a custom metric.

And it's the only one that's custom.

The only one that's added for us is time watched.

Now we want to add a dimension.

We're going to add a Dimension.

Custom Dimensions.

Genre.

Before we save the report, we can add different views. 

So far we have only seen using data from one view, like iOS OR Web. 

We can now select multiple views.

Here we see what opens on click.

OK, let's add everything Beacon. PAUSE

We have FIVE views.

We'll click save.

And there is our Report.

Here's the genre and the time watched.

Obviously, we aren't quite experts in report building from that introduction, but we see how to use those custom dimensions and metric.

**Slide 9
Let's do a quick review to drive home the learning points for this video.

Brightcove adds custom dimensions and a custom metric for our use.

And there is how to navigate to see both.

We've looked at a brief example using a custom dimension and custom metric in a custom report.

We know we aren't experts in building reports from what we did in this video, but to learn more,  a great place to start is the Google Analytics Academy.

**Slide 10
Thanks for watching another video, and moreover thanks for being a Brightcove customer!

Sadly this is the end of not only this video but another Brightcove Beacon course. But fear not, chances are you still have other courses to watch in this series. Enjoy and learn.
