**Intro/SLide 2
Google Analytics is the tool we use to see what our viewers are watching in our Brightcove Beacon apps.

Brightcove supplies for us dashboards, reports, dimensions and a metic, from which we can see viewer information or build our own dashboards and reports.

The objectives for this course are:
We will open Google Analytics and see how to view a Dashboard customized for our use, and is added to our account by Brightcove.
Similarly, in Google Data Studio we will view a Report customized for Brightcove Beacon, which is also added to our account by Brightcove.
Next, we will learn what dimensions and metrics are in terms of analytics, and view the custom dimensions and one metric added to our account.
Lastly, we'll take a peak at building reports in Google Analytics and use the custom dimensions and metic in a custom report.
