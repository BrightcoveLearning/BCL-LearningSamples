**Slide 1
In this video, you will learn how to view the Google Analytics Dashboard and Google Data Studio Report, both of which Brightcove will place in your Google Analytics report.

**Slide 2
Those are our two only two agenda items.

**Slide 3
First we will go and look at the Dashboard that Brightcove will add to your Google Analytics account.

**Slide 4
Here is some information on that dashboard.

The fist bullet is Google's definition of what an Analytics Dashboard is.

As we would expect, the Dashboard is customizable. We will take a very quick into building dashboards, but the goal of this course is NOT to teach Google Analytics.

Once we go into Google Analytics we will have to do three things to see the Brightcove supplied Dashboard. They are:
1. Choose the desired account
2. Choose the desired view
3. From the UI navigation choose Customization then Dashboards, and we will see a link for the Dashboard.

Also notice a document exists that addresses the information in this video.

OK, let's go now and look at the Dashboard.

**Web Google Analytics
We are logged in, and so the first task from the slide is to choose.

We'll select Beacon → Beacon Web → All Web Site Data.

Next Customization → Dashboards

And there we see Top Beacon

Click on that, and here we see the dashboard built for us by Brightcove and placed in our account.
(LEAVE time to scroll)

**Slide 5
This is definitely NOT a course on Google Analytics, but lets take a quick peek into building a dashboard

**Back to gave
We're going to go back into Analytics, then dashboards, create, and blank canvas.


For the name I will say VideoDemo.


I know if it's a date for me, I can delete it.

Let's use a couple of these widgets.

The first one we're going to do is a geo map and we just want to find by country where the users are, and name it countries

Click on Geo Map.

And then the first part of the metric is country. BTW in another video in this course the details of what a metric is will be discussed.

Now we'll select users, which is way at the bottom of this list.

And click save.

As if by magic we see the GeoMap with countries.

Let's add another widget.

Assume we are curious about video time watched by genre, so a name is TW by Genre.

A pie chart is a good way to display that.

Add a metric, this is a long list, so let's search for time watched, and select it.

The group by value is genre

Now save

And we see our viewers seem to be big fans of action movies.

All right, there's a very quick intro to building dashboards using widgets.

**Slide 6
Now we are going to view a DATA STUDIO report

There's a definition of Data Studio from Google.

Although not completely accurate, we can think Data Studio as dashboards with drawing tools added in.

Data Studio reports are customizable, but Brightcove made the report they added as non-customizable.

And the three steps to see the report much like viewing a dashboard.

**Web Data Studio
Into the Data Studio.

And here's the one that's supplied for us.

We see the visually enhanced dashboard.

Notice it has pages. This Data Studio report has three pages.
