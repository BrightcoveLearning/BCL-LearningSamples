First we are going to discuss how to ingest videos from Video Cloud to Brightcove Beacon

Ingest Content:
To ingest the videos, and playlists by the way, you need to use the Brightcove Beacon UI. In the UI, click the Tools option, which is the icon that looks like a wrench. Click the Ingestion menu option from on the left side of the screen. Now simply click the Update Brightcove Videos button, and the corresponding Update Brightcove Playlists button if you choose.
