**Slide 2
Brightcove Beacon's video assets are stored in Video Cloud. In this course, you will learn how to setup the connection between Video Cloud and Brightcove Beacon.

Part of implementing this connection is using metadata on the Video Cloud videos so when they are ingested into Brightcove Beacon they function as intended. This metadata is stored in custom fields, so you will need to understand how to create and populate Video Cloud custom fields.

A couple of examples would be instructive to see this connection in action.

**Studio
Here we are looking a video that is an episode of a series. The custom fields define the series and season to which this video belongs, and also defines what episode number it is in the particular season.

**App
After this video is ingested, we see it is in fact showing up just as defined in the custom fields.

**Studio
Here is a video which has been assigned custom field values that tell it to use advertising. 

**App
And here is that video with a pre-roll and a mid-roll at 5 seconds

**Slide 3
So what should you learn from this course, let's look at the objectives.

First, it needs to be clear that videos in your Brightcove Beacon app come from Video Cloud

Second, you will know the steps of how to create and populate custom fields, then ingest the video to which you have added custom field values

Lastly, you really need to know the documentation that will help you accomplish the second objective. There are lots of custom fields to be created, and details of their use. The documentation will guide you to successfully ingesting Video Cloud assets into Brightcove Beacon.

**Slide 4
There are four more videos in this On Demand training course.

The first helps you see how metadata fields automatically created for every Video Cloud video can be leveraged in Brightcove Beacon.

Next, you've already seen that custom fields are key to get videos ingested into Brightcove Beacon properly, so you will need to know how to create those custom fields.

The third video goes into details about the types of custom fields you will use, and how to populate them

Finally, after doing all the work of uploading videos into Video Cloud and populating the custom fields, you will of course want to use them. The last video shows you how to ingest the videos into Brightcove Beacon and clear the app cache so you can see your work come to fruition!

Thanks for being a Brightcove Beacon customer, and hope you enjoy the course!!
