In this video, I will be helping you learn about the three different types of pages we can use in a Brightcove Beacon app. All of the pages serve VERY different purposes.

First we have configurable pages. In the Brightcove Beacon UI we will see these are called SCREEN pages. We use these pages to layout how viewers should see our video content. In this course, a later video is entirely dedicated to creating and configuring these kind of pages.

Next are non-configurable pages. These pages are like system pages, which provide viewers info about the app, the status of the app and their activities in the app. For instance 
-Downloads
-Settings
-Favorites

are all examples of non-configurable pages.

The last type of page only applies to Brightcove Beacon web apps, and these are redirect pages. These pages redirect to other web pages.

**Slide 3
Lets fill in the Why/What and Hows about configurable pages.

**Slide 4
Before examining these details, let's go look at some configurable pages in an actual Brightcove Beacon web app.

**Web app
The Home page is showing a featured playlist of videos in a carousel across the top, then using tabs to let viewers choose what other videos to browse.

The tabs show Florida beaches in another carousel, while the Living Desert Animals are displayed in a grid.

Already we see we have different thumbnail sizes and different display layout possibilities.

On the Test Page we see a configurable page that uses a hero image. The background is an uploaded image, then we can choose what and how to display videos.

For the last example, the All Playlists page shows two playlists displayed in Grids, but of different sized thumbnails.

**Slide 4 again
A few details here. Configurable pages are called screen pages in the Brightcove Beacon UI.

The layouts are quite flexible, but not quite totally free form, hence the quotes.

And as mentioned, another video in this course goes into details of configurable page creation and the various options and layouts.

**Slide 5
We choose non-configurable pages from the type list, and that's it, no further configuration allowed

Slide 6
Before examining these details, let's go look at some non-configurable pages in an actual Brightcove Beacon web app.

**Web app
In this app, Favorites, Recently Watched and Settings are the non-configurable pages used.

**Slide 6 again
These pages are also referred to as system or core pages, which provide info on the status of the app and what viewers have done in the app

Some non-configurable pages permit you to choose a layout in the Wizard, but once selected the layout is not configurable in the Brightcove Beacon UI

Listed are some example non-configurable pages. 

**Slide 7
Here are two different layouts for the Landing page. Once you choose one of these, there are no tweaks you can make to your selection.

**Slide 8
Here's a note to make us aware that not every page will appear the same on every platform, and sometimes pages won't appear at all based on a particular configuration

**Slide 9
Redirect pages are only for use on the Brightcove Beacon WEB apps, and quite straight forward to implement.

**Slide 10
Again, let's see an example of the page type in action before looking at implementation details.

**Web app
When the Redirect Demo link is clicked, we are redirected to a new tab and sent to a URL that was specified, in this case the Brightcove Beacon docs index page.

In this case a new tab was opened, but you can choose another type if you want to redirect to a new page in the SAME tab.

**Slide 10 again
Again, redirect pages only good for web apps

There are two redirect types, redirect-blank and redirect-self. These are akin to using anchors/links in HTML, if you have ever done that. 

The redirect-blank opens a specified URL in a NEW tab, and the redirect-self opens a specified URL in the SAME tab.

**Slide 11
Redirect type pages add one configuration tab, and that is where we place the specified URL

**Slide 12
Let's review the main learning points.

We have three types of pages
1. Configurable, called screen types in the UI, and are used to display video content in a layout under our control.
2. Non-configurable which provide system and user interaction information
3. Finally, redirect which are used in Brightcove Beacon web apps and provide, not surprisingly, redirect functionality.


Thanks much, and enjoy Brightcove Beacon.
