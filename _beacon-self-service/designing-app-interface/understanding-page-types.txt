We have three types of pages, which serve VERY different purposes.

First on non-configurable pages. These pages are like system pages, provide viewers info about the app and status of the app. For instance 
-Downloads
-Settings
-Favorites
-Recently watched

are all examples of non-configurable pages.

They are called non-configurable as you choose a layout, and that is how the page will look. You cannot go in and tweak the page in any way.

Next we have configurable pages. In the Brightcove Beacon UI they are listed as SCREEN type pages.
