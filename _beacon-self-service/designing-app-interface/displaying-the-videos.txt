**Cover Page
One of the most essential functions of any Brightcove Beacon app is displaying videos for viewers to choose to watch. In this video, I am going to help you learn how to display videos on a page and control the layouts of the thumbnails that represent videos.

**Slide 2
In this video we'll have four main points to learn. And here they are:

Only certain kinds of pages can display videos, and we'll learn those types and how to create those pages.

Next, we'll actually build a page that utilizes different blocks, layouts and playlists to display the videos in a manner we choose.

This will give us a basis on which to organize the rest of the learning points from the video, rather than discussing items in the abstract before seeing a page and actual layout created.

Key to the layout of pages that display videos are afore mentioned blocks and layouts. These items control the look of the video display  pages.

When we use blocks and layouts, the videos that are displayed by these must be in playlists. We'll gain a high level understanding of playlists.

**Slide 3
This is a quick glimpse of where we are headed. This is a screenshot of the Brightcove Beacon UI to build pages. The gray dropdown displays all the page types. In this list, screen and screen-hero_image are where our focus will be in this video. The colorful nested boxes at the bottom of the screenshot are how we will place content on configurable pages and utilize blocks, layouts and playlists.

**Slide 4
The only type of page we can use to display videos are configurable or screen type pages. Let's dig into these.

**Slide 5
As we've said,  configurable pages are used to display videos.

We'll soon see that configurable pages are called screen pages in the Brightcove Beacon UI.

Not surprisingly the Brightcove Beacon UI provides functionality to layout videos on a configurable page.

There are two types of these video layout pages, screen and screen-hero_image

**Web app
Let's look at each type. Most common is screen. And we can display videos in multiple ways, as show on these pages.

And this is an example of a screen-hero_image, where the background is an image we've uploaded.

**Slide 6
Now let's actually build a configurable page.

**Slide 7
In this page we are going to use the following:
First, at the top of the page a Featured banner, which means the thumbnails will be large
Next, a carousel that display thumbnails in portrait orientation
And lastly, two grids of thumbnails that we can choose which one to view based on tabs

OK, let's get started.

**UI

In the UI, we'll go to the pages tab.

Before clicking the new page button, we'll want to decide where our new page should be located in the  menu, and get a the Order number for that position. This time lets use 75.

That will put it right after recently watched.

Now click the Add new page button

For Basic data we will provide the System Title, which is the internal name. And here we'll use LayoutDemo. Here we use a name with no spaces just to show that this name can be different than the name that is visible in the actual app.

Then use the Order number we chose earlier.

We don't need to worry about Friendly URL or Genre Type.

Now select a page type, for this walkthrough we'll choose screen, which lets us add video content, and is the topic of this video.

For the menu item appearance, Presentation Type form field,  text is fine.

Now finally onto the layout.

We have three entity entities to use, blocks, layouts, and playlists.

The relationship is that blocks contain the layouts, and the layouts contain the playlists. Playlist are our video data.

Let's use those tools to build a layout.

We have a single block, which means we can only put one layout in it.

And we select the layout to be Featured Banner Labels Out, which means the thumbnails will be large, the labels not covering any part of the thumbnail.

Now we add the actual video data, via a playlist.

Choose Waves as the playlist.

For contrast lets add a playlist where the thumbnails are portrait orientation.

Again, we are putting in just one playlist, so we'll add another single block.

For the layout choose Carousel Posters 5 Columns Labels In, which gives us the portrait orientation.

And for the videos, lets choose the Florida Beaches.

We want more data on the page, and we will use a tabbed block. 
 
The tabbed block uses menu tabs, from which the viewer can choose what to watch.

In the tabbed block first add	a Grid 3 Columns Landscape Labels In

By the way, in a tabbed block the layouts must be the same, and the layouts should be a type of grid. So we've made a correct choice.

Then add the Oregon Coast playlist, which will be displayed in the grid just selected

Add another Grid 3 Columns Landscape Labels In

And add the Living Desert Animals as the playlist.

Kind of messy looking, but hopefully by going through the process of building it we can better decipher it.

Now through the rest of the tabs quickly so we can view the new page in the app.

For Textual data, enter the Title viewers will see as a menu Item in the actual Brightcove Beacon apps, so Layout Demo, with a space this time.

For non-textual data, icons can be uploaded that appear either beside or in place of the text name in the menu. By the way, these icons do NOT work in the web apps.

The backgrounds are only needed if using a specific type of screen page.

Tags is not functioning now, so we can skip that.

Lastly Rights & Scheduling. Be sure the page is published.

Enter dates when the page can be used.

Indicate the devices on which the page can be viewed.

And lastly handle the locations. Be sure at least one permitted location is supplied.

Click Create Page to actually create the new page. 

And we have a new page!!

We want to see immediately if the process worked, so the cache needs to be cleared.

And we'll head to the web app so see the fruits of our labor.

**Web app
Refresh the page, and there is our new page. 

To confirm, a featured carousel at the top

Portrait thumbnails for Florida Beaches

In the tabbed block, first the oregon coast videos in a grid

And the Living Desert Animals using the same layout

Yes! Just as we planned.

**Slide 8
Lets find out about all the possibilities when it come to blocks and layouts.

**Slide 9
As we've just seen blocks contain layouts and layouts contain playlists.

We need to get a handle on all the block/layout possibilities, and a great doc exists to help us with that, so lets go have a look

**Intro pages doc 
This is the Introducing Pages document.

We see the type list, and explanations of the different page types.

Then a table with all the page type details. By the way, there is a video in this course dedicated to explaining the page types.

And now here is what we want to look at more closely

As we've seen, we have blocks, layout and playlists to manipulate the display of our videos.

And here are the different kinds of blocks highlighted in yellow.

Let's look at an example of each kind of block.

We've just used a single-block, and that is when we want to put a single layout in a block.

The example shows a carousel in a single block.

The note shown is from the UI when an attempt was made to change a block that can hold multiple layouts to a single-block. That is not allowed.

And here is a list-block with three carousels, and shows we can put multiple layout/playlist combinations in a list-block.

Next a tabbed block, which we used earlier. This example shows three grids in the tabbed block, hence three tabs.

And finally the dropdown block, which in function is like the tabbed block, it permits the viewer to select one of multiple GRIDS to view. A dropdown box is used for selection in place of tabs.

Now we come to layouts. We won't go through an example of every layout, because they're basically combinations of a limited set of block and layout permutations.

What we will examine is each individual feature that make up these combinations.

First of all, we have a carousel and the labels in.

A carousel, as we've seen, displays the thumbnails across in a single row.

Here's A carousel with the labels out, so with the labels in - part of our thumbnail is covered.

Featured means our thumbnail images here are going to be larger, in fact the largest they can be using any layout.

We see this image is bigger than this one, so this is a featured carousel.

Often, but not always, a featured layout is used at the top of a page.

In some layouts we can choose to have our thumbnails displayed in landscape or as posters in portrait orientation.

This is the one that the name of the layout can lead to a bit of confusion.

We might think Grid three means three thumbnails across in a grid.

No, that's the wrong answer.

What the Grid three and Grid 4 refers to is their relative sizes.

Here is a Grid 3 and Grid 4 showing three and four thumbnails across respectively. 

This is a screenshot with the browser 800 pixels wide, and we do get three across and four across.

But if we have a wider screen, here's the grid 3 at 4 across, and the grid 4 is 5 across.

So, really featured,  grid three, and grid four have to do with relative thumbnail size.

The biggest thumbnails are displayed by featured, the next biggest ones are Grid three, then the smallest ones would be grid four.

And finally in this doc, a reference to the five tabs we see when creating a pages, which we've done in this video.

**Slide 10
The videos are contained in playlists, which we put in the layouts. A few quick details on playlists now.

**Slide 11
To answer the question, "Why Must the Videos be in Playlists?", well, that is the only entity we can place in a layout.

Playlists are created either in Video Cloud Studio or the Brightcove Beacon UI

If created in Brightcove Beacon UI, a playlist can contain other types of assets in addition to videos, like series and events

There is an entire course in this collection of Brightcove Beacon courses dedicated to playlist creation and configuration

**Slide 12
Here we are at the end of yet another video.

Let's review the main learning points to reinforce out learning.

First, configurable pages are used to display videos, and in the Brightcove Beacon UI the configurable pages are called screen pages

To control the display of the videos, we use block, layouts and playlists

Playlists contain videos, but can contain other media assets

What makes coming to the end of this video even more sad than ending other videos in this course, is that this is the last video of this particular course. But never fear, more courses are available about Brightcove Beacon!
