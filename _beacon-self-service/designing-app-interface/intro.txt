As we continue to use our Brightcove Beacon apps, we'll almost invariably want to change the application. Maybe we want to add a page for a holiday, or put more videos on a page as new content becomes available. All this is done by using the four items listed here:
*Pages contain content, also are represented by a menu item.
*Playlist content are the videos to display on a page. The videos are contained in a playlist, and you put playlists on a page.
*Configurable pages are are a page type on which videos are placed.
*Non-configurable pages are pages that you choose to include, but cannot customize them in the Brightcove Beacon UI. For instance, we may want a favorites page, or a recently watched page. Great, we add them to the app and that's it. No customization.

**Web app
Let's go look at examples of these items in a Brightcove Beacon web app.

First, we see these menu items, and each one represent a page.

As we see a page that displays videos, we are seeing video from playlists.

Here we see videos placed in this page in a certain way, so we know it is a configurable, also called a screen, page.

Recently Watched is an example of a non-configurable page. We want one and it is placed in the app. It is possible there might be different layouts of the Recently Watched page, but the layout is chosen early in the design process and whichever one you choose, the design of that selection is fixed.

**Objective Slide
Here are the objectives for the course. These are most important learning points we want to carry away from  watching the videos that comprise this course:
1. We need a conceptual understanding of configurable and non-configurable page types.
2. Building pages and populating them with video content maybe the most important objective. We obviously need to know how to do that.
3. When adding content to pages, the formatting is done with blocks, layouts and and playists. We need to know what they are, but more importantly actually be able to use the interface to leverage blocks, layouts and playlists to display videos in the manner we wish.
4. Certain non-configurable pages will be selected for use in the app based upon our business cases.


**Slide 3
This is a quick glimpse of where we are headed. This is the Brightcove Beacon UI to build pages. The gray dropdown are all the page types. The colorful nested boxes at the bottom of the screenshot are how we will place content on configurable pages.
