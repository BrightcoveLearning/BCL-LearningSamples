00:09 - 00:16
Ok, today's topic in our exciting series of Beacon Courses, Designing the Application Layout.

00:17 - 00:26
Of course, you'll want to add content or add a page or whatever it may be and this will give us the skills to do that.

00:27 - 00:40
Basically, when we are designing the page, designing the app, we have four mange items we can use to change the design, enhance the design.

00:40 - 00:42
Whatever you wanna call it, we have pages.

00:42 - 00:53
And by the way, we'll see pages directly, correspond to menu items there, 1 to 1, the playlist content, and that's actually what videos do we want to show.

00:53 - 00:58
And we show the videos on something called configurable pages.

00:58 - 01:03
And we also have non configurable pages, right?

01:03 - 01:08
So, those are the tools we have to create our app design.

01:08 - 01:12
And if you have any questions or comments, we got great feedback.

01:12 - 01:13
The last two times we've done this.

01:13 - 01:20
So please just interrupt me with questions, or interrupt me with corrections, or if you have added content.
Bob Bailey
01:21 - 01:22
A map.

01:22 - 01:23
Yeah.

01:23 - 01:23
I.
Bob Bailey
01:23 - 01:26
Think what I would do, like, I was going to ask you if we should interrupt you.
Bob Bailey
01:26 - 01:49
I think what I would almost do is, start off with just like, a couple of screenshots to just show, like what you mean by application design, like showing a screenshot of light to television, with the images up there, or whatever, You know, just like, like three images on top of, you know, kind of overlapping to just kinda throw out what you mean by application design.

01:50 - 01:51
Yep, OK.

01:52 - 01:57
I am going right now to actually show an application design, but that's a good idea.

02:00 - 02:00
Notes here.

02:02 - 02:02
Alright.

02:02 - 02:06
So let's go see what this actually means, right?

02:06 - 02:08
What do these things mean?

02:08 - 02:10
So, let's go into an app.

02:11 - 02:18
And, here is an app, And this is the home page.

02:18 - 02:23
And so the application design, things we can control, or what's on the menu here, right?

02:23 - 02:27
What's displayed and how they're displayed.

02:28 - 02:33
And, so what we want to talk about are those four things.

02:34 - 02:38
First of all, the pages, the pages correspond to menu items.

02:38 - 02:47
And I even asked, like, I always hate to say something absolute, until I know it's true, and, so, I said, our pages in menu items.

02:47 - 02:50
Are they 1 to 1, And the answer is yes, right.

02:50 - 02:56
When you create a page, then you're gonna get a menu item for it, if it's published, and meets all the requirements.

02:56 - 03:00
Right, so that's what we mean by the different pages.

03:00 - 03:03
So, here's the wine: This town holds a single series.

03:04 - 03:11
Here's the different playlists we have, and then there's some other things.

03:11 - 03:26
And I want to talk about these first because we're talking about configurable pages in playlists, and that's where these come from, basically configurable pages When you add those to your app, like, this is a configurable page.

03:26 - 03:28
That's where we show videos.

03:28 - 03:29
Right?

03:29 - 03:30
It's that simple.

03:30 - 03:33
If we're going to show videos were in charge of how it looks.

03:33 - 03:35
That's a configurable page.

03:35 - 03:38
Also, the screen type will see is on the page.

03:38 - 03:40
Type is called a screen.

03:40 - 03:41
That's the way it is.

03:42 - 03:45
So then we also mentioned these non breakable pages.

03:45 - 03:51
So, for instance, Favorites is a non configurable page, you can say, I want to include this.

03:52 - 03:52
And he said, Well, no.

03:52 - 03:56
I want it to have like, poster images.

03:56 - 03:58
And I don't want channels.

03:58 - 04:01
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, Non configurable.

04:01 - 04:04
You say I want Favorites.

04:04 - 04:05
And it is what it is.

04:05 - 04:08
You were some of these non configurable pages.

04:08 - 04:14
You have a choice of layouts, but once you choose the layout, that's it.

04:14 - 04:15
There's no like tweaking it.

04:15 - 04:17
So this is a non configurable page.

04:17 - 04:22
Recently watched another non configurable page.

04:24 - 04:37
And we're gonna see Settings actually is non configurable page, but we have a couple different layouts we can choose, but if you don't like this order, nope, it's non configurable, you can't do that.

04:41 - 04:44
Now, another thing I just want to show you, kind of, this is an inch row.

04:44 - 04:44
And.

04:46 - 04:59
Let's look at this page, so we seem to have like, some kind of carousel here, and then we have these tabs that we can do different playlist sweat.

04:59 - 05:03
I'm going to real quickly jump in to the Bright co beacon.

05:05 - 05:13
Cms here, or the Brightcove Beacon UI, I'm going to home and we see this at first.

05:13 - 05:14
I remember the first time I looked at.

05:14 - 05:16
This is like, oh, my God.

05:16 - 05:21
But, it's not too terrible once you get used to it.

05:21 - 05:24
I'm just going to grab this real quick, we're going to look at this later.

05:24 - 05:34
Also, but basically, we lay out, and what's called a block, and we want to feature, which has to do with how big the images are.

05:35 - 05:39
I want the labels outside, and then the playlist I want as waves, OK?

05:39 - 05:46
So, I want us to kinda understand how we're gonna approach this before we dive into the details, which we'll do a little later.

05:46 - 05:49
And again, I have another one.

05:49 - 05:53
A tab block, I know that spelled wrong, but I don't have any control of that.

05:53 - 05:57
And then I have a carousel here, right?

05:57 - 06:04
And of Florida Beaches and Living Desert animals.

06:04 - 06:08
So, these are the actual things, we mean, Like, what is the application design?

06:08 - 06:10
So, this is what we can change.

06:10 - 06:14
Like, what pages we want, we have control over some of those pages.

06:15 - 06:25
And some, if we may have a layout to choose, but, that's all then, we call those non configurable, by the way, and this, I wouldn't teach this in.

06:25 - 06:25
A normal wouldn't say this.

06:25 - 06:33
In a normal class, we're still battling over what these pages should be called, like, configurable non configurable.

06:33 - 06:42
Some people are calling the non configurable, like, Favorites recently watched, and settings like system pages.

06:42 - 06:46
So, if you're thinking to be thinking about good words for those, as we continue.

06:46 - 06:50
And, we'll gather some info, hopefully at the end.

06:52 - 06:53
This way.

06:54 - 07:01
All right, so we've seen that an action, and now we have some idea what we even mean by application design.

07:01 - 07:06
We know we have these configurable pages where the videos go, it's playlist content, it.

07:06 - 07:08
Add on there, and I can control some of those.

07:10 - 07:16
And we've seen this colorful block down here, and these are the page types.

07:16 - 07:22
This will really be, a lot of our effort, in this course, will be understanding these two things.

07:22 - 07:23
We're gonna pick a page type.

07:24 - 07:27
And, if it's a screen one, then we can configure it.

07:29 - 07:31
All right, main learning points.

07:31 - 07:46
So, whenever I think about this, I hope tomorrow, if someone was to ask you, like, what did you learn yesterday in the designing, the application design course, and these are, I hope, the things that you learned.

07:46 - 07:49
Number one, we have different types of pages.

07:49 - 07:50
And we've talked about two of them.

07:50 - 07:51
There's only three.

07:51 - 07:57
So, we have different types of pages configurable, not configurable, and redirect pages.

08:00 - 08:02
We need to know how to create pages and build the menu.

08:02 - 08:07
Again, 1 to 1 correspondence, that's why I'm listening, listing them together.

08:09 - 08:15
We have to know how to build, configure our screen pages.

08:15 - 08:17
Those are the configurable pages.

08:18 - 08:21
And also, we want to know how to include non configurable pages.

08:23 - 08:31
Now, you can probably guess, we're going to jump into these understanding the types of pages I pointed out, non configurable, configurable.

08:31 - 08:36
I still want to show you what a redirect pages, and those of you that have been around for awhile.

08:37 - 08:39
Redirect Pages may be new to you.

08:39 - 08:43
They have come in, I don't know how long ago, but I know they weren't around initially.

08:44 - 08:49
So, again, just real quickly to review, and I hope you're already sick of this, and you already know.

08:49 - 08:56
So, for instance, the Homepage, Configurable, America's coastline's, that's I'm in Charge, configurable.

08:56 - 08:58
This is just showing one series.

08:58 - 09:05
I can put all these series under one, uh, on one page and call, like Series, if we want.

09:06 - 09:10
All Playlists, again, configurable, I'm in charge of that.

09:10 - 09:12
Favorites.

09:12 - 09:14
Nope, we talked about that.

09:15 - 09:22
Recently watched, it is what it is, Settings, you can pick a couple of different layouts.

09:22 - 09:23
That's it.

09:23 - 09:30
Now, the third type of page is called a redirect, and this is only for the web app.

09:31 - 09:32
Right.

09:32 - 09:35
Beacon is going to generate different kinds of half the only for the web app.

09:35 - 09:42
And so, what this lets you do, you can put a page that automatically just when you click it, shoots you off to another page.

09:42 - 09:50
And so, watch appear as Bright Cove, and then CMS, I'm going to click the redirect and notice a new tab opens.

09:50 - 09:52
And I am shooting at the.

09:55 - 09:56
Beacon documentation.

09:57 - 10:00
And you have the option with these redirect pages.

10:01 - 10:13
You can either have it open in a new tab, or you can have it replaced the tab, you're in, which would be a little odd, because that would basically be getting rid of the, the app, the Bronco Beacon app.

10:15 - 10:17
Again, feel free to ask questions.

10:18 - 10:20
All right, non configurable.

10:20 - 10:21
See some information there.

10:21 - 10:23
We've already discussed, Configurable.

10:23 - 10:27
We're also going to call a screen page, and we have these redirect pages.

10:28 - 10:36
Here's an example of non configurable, and I said, you can sometimes sometimes choose different layout.

10:36 - 10:37
So, here's one.

10:37 - 10:42
You say, oh, these are my sign in, or I think they call landing page, right?

10:42 - 10:43
Landing page.

10:43 - 10:48
You have two different ways, it can work, but once you choose it, you can't change the order, that kind of stuff.

10:50 - 10:57
Also, sometimes, you're gonna add a page, it'll look different, depending on the platform.

10:57 - 11:02
So on the left-hand side, when you add a search, in fact, search is always in the web app.

11:03 - 11:16
It just happens, but with the i-phone, you'll actually get when you add the page, and you'll actually get a search option on the i-phone, excuse me, on the i-phone.

11:16 - 11:18
So it's not like there.

11:18 - 11:22
It's going to be exactly the same across all platforms.

11:22 - 11:26
For instance, if there's no registered users, it's smart enough to know.

11:26 - 11:32
It's not gonna, if you say, I want to log out page, if there's no registered users that knows, that doesn't make sense.

11:32 - 11:33
No one's login.

11:33 - 11:34
And so why would somebody want to log out?

11:35 - 11:35
All right.

11:35 - 11:38
So, just some details about non configurable pages.

11:40 - 11:47
Showing you a whole bunch of these Basically video pages, and I've considered maybe suggesting that for the name, for these configurable pages.

11:47 - 11:48
They're like the page.

11:48 - 11:50
There's the pages that contain videos.

11:50 - 11:56
The only thing that makes that tricky is, like recently watched and favorites, also have videos on them.

11:58 - 12:05
The redirect pages, if you haven't used one of these before, when you go in and you build the page, you get an extra tab.

12:05 - 12:24
It's almost always these five tabs, but you get this external redirect, and you put in the link in there, that's all and and, like, I said, we'll see, there's, you can control, if you want it, Just like you do in an anchor HTML anchor, you can choose if it opens in a New tab or in the same tab.

12:27 - 12:28
Alright, pause for a second.

12:28 - 12:35
Any questions you might have, right now, any clarifications needed?
Armando Navarro
12:37 - 12:38
Not so far from me.
Armando Navarro
12:38 - 12:39
Thanks!

12:39 - 12:40
Cool!
Bob Bailey
12:40 - 12:41
Hey, Matt.

12:41 - 12:41
Just.
Bob Bailey
12:41 - 12:43
Have a comment on the slides.
Bob Bailey
12:44 - 12:52
If you go back a few you had like the title, it was like Configure Pages and then you said details wanted details to like.
Bob Bailey
12:52 - 12:54
I don't think I would put that up there.
Bob Bailey
12:55 - 12:57
I think I would just say, now, I can figure old pages.
Bob Bailey
12:58 - 13:03
Then, if anything, on the second slide, just say, like, you know, how, yes, you will see, like, continued or something.

13:04 - 13:05
I can put content.
Bob Bailey
13:06 - 13:06
In here.

13:07 - 13:07
Yeah.

13:08 - 13:12
I just wanted to make sure that they knew was not configurable pages.

13:12 - 13:14
And there are a couple of details.

13:14 - 13:15
Yeah, I'll look at that.

13:19 - 13:19
Thank you.

13:23 - 13:33
Now, of course, we need to know how to actually create a page, and we're going to go in to the Brico Beacon UI.

13:33 - 13:43
There's actually a Pages tab, and then there's the add new page, but probably not too exciting there, figure it is, and then we have some basic kinds of information.

13:43 - 13:47
There's the five tabs we almost see when we're creating anything.

13:48 - 13:51
So, rather than just looking at slides about that, let's go.
Bob Bailey
13:51 - 13:52
Yeah.

13:53 - 13:53
Yeah.
Bob Bailey
13:53 - 13:55
Just the suggestion here.
Bob Bailey
13:56 - 13:58
This is called creating a page.
Bob Bailey
13:58 - 14:02
I think the first bullet point I would have would be the second bullet you have.

14:02 - 14:03
Ok.
Bob Bailey
14:03 - 14:06
It's like, let's talk about creating a page, How do I do that?
Bob Bailey
14:06 - 14:14
In the UI, go to pages, add new page, and then say you're after you create a page, then a lake is, you know what, I mean, just reverse the Apple, it's wanted to?

14:15 - 14:15
Yep.

14:16 - 14:16
Good.

14:26 - 14:27
All right.

14:27 - 14:29
Going to go into.

14:31 - 14:38
The Bright co beacon UI of the CMS as we refer to it now, I'm going to click on Pages, going to add a New page.

14:39 - 14:43
System Title, and I'm just can put the date on here, because I know then I can delete it.

14:43 - 14:48
So it's my one October page.

14:48 - 14:51
Now, the order I'm going to jump right out of this, actually.

14:52 - 14:55
The order number is here.

14:55 - 15:02
And what the order means is What order do I want the menu items to appear?

15:02 - 15:10
So for instance, one is Home American coastlines Travel Show Cooking Show, and sure enough, though they are.

15:11 - 15:11
Right?

15:13 - 15:14
Yeah, what.
Bob Bailey
15:14 - 15:17
Happens if I put the same order on two pages?

15:17 - 15:21
The first one gets shown, The second one does not.

15:27 - 15:31
Yeah, that's what, actually, I haven't tested that we could test that, but that's what I was told.

15:31 - 15:34
When I asked that same question to someone's, I should test that.
Bob Bailey
15:34 - 15:34
Yeah.
Bob Bailey
15:34 - 15:38
That seems kinda, like bad, right?
Bob Bailey
15:38 - 15:42
Like you would think it would go by Alphabet or something like to just not show it as kinda.
Bob Bailey
15:42 - 15:43
I don't know.
Bob Bailey
15:43 - 15:43
All right.
Bob Bailey
15:43 - 15:44
Just curious.

15:44 - 15:45
Yeah.

15:46 - 15:47
Yeah.

15:47 - 15:49
So, again, so we know what the order is.

15:49 - 15:50
So let's go back.

15:50 - 15:51
We'll do a new page.

15:52 - 16:05
The one, whoops, October page, this is the internal name, and you probably gonna wanna make it the same as the text page, but I I like to do them different in training.

16:05 - 16:08
So, you know, they can be different.

16:08 - 16:11
But on the other hand, it can be distracting.

16:11 - 16:17
Amina, confusing, if you name this, and it's really no relation to the actual name, that can be a little tricky.

16:17 - 16:21
So I want to put, this is five.

16:21 - 16:23
We're going to tasks will see what happens here.

16:23 - 16:31
The friendly name, the genre type right now, this is going to disappear, by the way.

16:31 - 16:37
Now this is where I pick This is where I pick the screen type.

16:38 - 16:38
Right.

16:38 - 16:44
And so let's say we're going to do another redirect page.

16:44 - 16:47
We're going to talk about all these types later, where we get information.

16:47 - 16:51
So I'll do a redirect, because all we're going to do is create it, and then we're going to end it.

16:52 - 16:52
Yeah.

16:54 - 16:55
Do that.

16:55 - 16:58
And if you have an icon, will see a non textual data.

16:58 - 17:07
If you have pages, you can do an icon, and the text, or just the icon, or just the tax if you upload those.

17:07 - 17:16
And right now, this whole thing, notice we only see that kind of light up when we do a screen page, and then we can put stuff down here.

17:17 - 17:18
But, that's special.

17:18 - 17:20
We're going to talk about that also.

17:23 - 17:33
Now, the textual data and this is the name that will appear in the menu, so I'm gonna stay with one October, Paige.

17:33 - 17:33
Good.

17:36 - 17:37
Non textual data.

17:37 - 17:45
For instance, if you want an icon and if there are hovered over it, in go clicked on, like if it's the actual page, you can have the icon change.

17:46 - 18:04
Horizontal background, vertical background, I could never figure out what this was for until I started to look at more detail, and there was another new kind of page added than the last time I looked carefully called the hero page, and I'll show you why we have to upload those when we talk about the hero page.

18:05 - 18:09
So here, really, for most of the time, you don't have to upload anything.

18:10 - 18:16
Since I picked a redirect, here, we can put in the redirect.

18:25 - 18:29
Tags, not implemented right now, and writes and scheduling.

18:30 - 18:33
This probably starts to feel like Groundhog's Day.

18:33 - 18:39
If you work with the beacon much, because this almost always look the same, I want it published.

18:39 - 18:45
I'm gonna pick a date before today, I'm going to pick a date after today.

18:49 - 18:52
And I want all devices, OK.

18:52 - 18:54
Ama, let it for the world.

18:54 - 18:55
I have this.
Bob Bailey
18:56 - 18:57
Start date before today.

19:01 - 19:02
Oh, sorry.

19:02 - 19:02
I Yep.

19:03 - 19:03
Thanks.

19:05 - 19:05
Click through.

19:05 - 19:07
I was thinking it was September still.

19:08 - 19:08
Yeah.

19:08 - 19:10
So, thank you for catching that.

19:10 - 19:16
So, before today after day and I have this is the TIF later on, happened mean just today As a matter of fact.

19:17 - 19:25
I had created, when I first started playing with this instance, I had created a page and the favorites page actually wasn't showing up.

19:25 - 19:33
Like, what the heck, why isn't that showing up and then, went in here and sure enough, I'd put a date that had the end date had passed, right.

19:33 - 19:34
So, you want to make sure.

19:34 - 19:38
And I think Jeff and I found out, you have to put something in here.

19:39 - 19:40
Otherwise, you actually get an error.

19:40 - 19:42
If you try to view it, then.

19:43 - 19:45
So all these things are important to put in.

19:46 - 19:47
And that's the standard.

19:47 - 19:51
And even with the redirect, you get this X, this external redirect.

19:51 - 19:53
Which is a bonus to that.

19:54 - 19:55
So I'm going to create the new page.

19:59 - 20:01
I want to test it right away.

20:01 - 20:08
I don't want to wait an hour to see if it works and that's how often the cache will be cleared.

20:08 - 20:14
So it's kind of in determine, so I'm gonna go to the cache and I'm gonna, and I didn't load any images.

20:14 - 20:15
But I always pick both.

20:15 - 20:17
Now, we're gonna see this.

20:17 - 20:18
Let's see what happens.

20:18 - 20:19
I'm gonna go to pages.

20:20 - 20:22
Notice We have two: number: five.

20:23 - 20:24
Right.

20:24 - 20:34
And I don't know why this one, maybe, because I created it, so let's see if what I was told earlier, and I'll refresh this.

20:41 - 20:45
So what it did, Travel shop.

20:46 - 20:46
Yeah, it.

20:47 - 20:50
It replaced it, right, We're not seeing American coastlines.

20:51 - 20:57
So if you have the same number The one on top, probably I didn't know.

20:58 - 21:00
You know, there's no way to determine which would come first.

21:00 - 21:07
So, that's like a bad thing to do, Though, We'll go in, and let's make this like.

21:07 - 21:08
20.

21:14 - 21:15
Change this to 20.

21:23 - 21:25
I got to clear the cache again.

21:41 - 21:50
Sometimes, this isn't supposed to happen, but sometimes it happens where there'll be dumped out in testing into a.

21:55 - 21:58
Into a different CMS and we're on 45.

22:03 - 22:08
Used to happen all the time, now, I think, sometimes just happens some of the time.

22:08 - 22:11
So there's that back, and there's our one October page.

22:11 - 22:14
So what's going to happen since this is a redirect page.

22:14 - 22:16
Now, off, I go, right.

22:16 - 22:18
I was redirected the right code dot com.

22:21 - 22:25
And that's the process of creating pages.

22:29 - 22:32
Questions before we move on?

22:42 - 22:45
So, creating pages, We know where to go to do it.

22:45 - 22:52
We're going to have these five, And if you do redirect, you get the bonus external link, or whatever the tap was called.

22:52 - 22:58
And, again, we have the key documents listed here, and we also have them where this course will be posted.

22:59 - 23:02
There'll be like the video and beside it, the key documents listed.

23:05 - 23:10
Now, we want to go and look at configuring screen pages.

23:10 - 23:13
So, the screen pages are the configurable ones.

23:14 - 23:16
And we're gonna go to Brightcove.

23:16 - 23:19
Beacon UI, new pages, the basic data tab.

23:20 - 23:22
And we have three entity entities to use.

23:22 - 23:26
We have Blocks, layouts, and playlists.

23:26 - 23:33
So, blocks contain the layouts, and the layouts contain the playlists, which is your data.

23:33 - 23:36
And so, here's how it looks.

23:36 - 23:40
It's not, it takes a while to get used to it.

23:40 - 23:41
Let's say it that way.

23:41 - 23:45
If I have a single block, which means I can only put one thing in it.

23:45 - 23:53
And I put in the layout I want to feature, which means they're big, the labels outside.

23:54 - 23:56
And here's the data A-list block.

23:56 - 24:04
I can have multiple things in, and here's the carousel going across the labels in, and I could put two in there.

24:05 - 24:05
Right?

24:05 - 24:08
So, so that's how we can kind of look at this.

24:08 - 24:14
And we did that early on, the relationship between this, and how the page actually looks.

24:15 - 24:25
I do want to go out and show you some information from this doc called Introducing Pages, so you know what's there.

24:25 - 24:28
And also, it takes awhile to demo each thing.

24:28 - 24:32
And I'm going to show you some examples here, rather than going through.

24:32 - 24:39
And once and trying to build each one refresh.

24:39 - 24:40
It just takes too long.

24:40 - 24:43
So these are the types of pages.

24:43 - 24:54
If you haven't looked carefully for awhile, like I hadn't knew in some time, I don't know how long ago, redirect blank, redirect, self, and screen hero image.

24:55 - 25:03
I talked about the categories, just a quick review, non configurable screen, and here's this.

25:03 - 25:09
It's, this is like a special type of screen, this one, that is called the Hero Hero image.

25:09 - 25:15
And what that does, and I mentioned, you have to put in an image for this page because it kind of becomes background.

25:17 - 25:21
Right and what I wanted to do.

25:24 - 25:28
Yeah, Here's an example of the Hero page.

25:28 - 25:34
You have this big image here, and then you can put whatever content you want underneath it.

25:35 - 25:46
And you need to upload both the landscape image and a portrait damage landscape if you're on like a TV, and if you're on a mobile up and down, then you'll need the portrait image.

25:49 - 25:51
And the redirect pages.

25:51 - 25:57
This is just a table of all the, like, some specifics about that.

25:57 - 25:58
That's fine.

25:59 - 26:00
Screen pages, we're going to work on that.

26:00 - 26:05
Now, here's what I wanted to talk about, and it just takes too much time to demo.

26:05 - 26:08
So, first of all, we have different kinds of blocks.

26:08 - 26:13
So right here, we have a single block, means we can just add one thing, right.

26:13 - 26:13
That's it.

26:13 - 26:14
That's good.

26:15 - 26:24
List block, let's just put multiple things in and here what I've done, three carousels, and I've added three.

26:25 - 26:27
Different playlists ways.

26:27 - 26:28
Florida Beaches and Oregon Coast.

26:28 - 26:31
So that's the list block, Tabb block.

26:31 - 26:36
We've seen an example that, again, it's misspelled, but that's the way it is.

26:37 - 26:40
I have Waves, Oregon Coast in Florida Beaches.

26:40 - 27:00
Again, you can also use a drop-down block, and you get this drop-down over here with your three with your three different, in this case playlist, right, so these are the blocks, the four kind of blocks, again, single block, list, block.

27:01 - 27:04
Tab, block, and drop-down block.
Miguel Ascanio
27:05 - 27:18
One question to just to see, just check in by any chance, you know, um, what's the maximum amount of playlist that you can put up on, on the drop-down blog, too, you know?

27:19 - 27:21
No, idea, but that's a good question.

27:21 - 27:22
I'll find that out.
Miguel Ascanio
27:22 - 27:23
Alright, yeah.
Miguel Ascanio
27:23 - 27:24
I'll check that out as well.
Bob Bailey
27:26 - 27:27
Hey, Matt.

27:28 - 27:28
Yeah.
Bob Bailey
27:29 - 27:33
One, just a small comment for documentation.
Bob Bailey
27:34 - 27:36
I Don't know if we should use the word combos.
Bob Bailey
27:37 - 27:37
Right?
Bob Bailey
27:37 - 27:41
Because I'm just thinking for like, localization Like this combos makes sense.
Bob Bailey
27:41 - 27:43
Should we change it to combination.

27:44 - 27:44
Ok?
Bob Bailey
27:45 - 27:46
Just a small thing.

27:54 - 27:55
They can notes.

28:00 - 28:03
Same, I don't know if there's a limit, Like, I don't know what would happen.

28:03 - 28:06
If you have so many tabs, it's wider than your screen?

28:06 - 28:11
I don't know how they know that, but all I'll ask about that if there is some kind of limit.
Miguel Ascanio
28:12 - 28:14
All right, thanks.

28:14 - 28:15
Cool.

28:16 - 28:20
Now we have a bunch of different kinds of layouts.

28:20 - 28:29
And I'm not gonna go through each one, because they're basically combinations of a limited set of layout parameters, right?

28:29 - 28:37
And so we have these combinations, but again, they're just combine their combinations of this limited set.

28:37 - 28:46
So first of all, we have a carousel and the labels in So a carousel it lists some across on one, and here you can go to the edge.

28:46 - 29:01
And by the way, I don't think I have on my demo, you do have a view all page and when you get to the end, if there's a whole bunch, you can rather than having a carousel of like one thousand videos, you can say, I want I think it's 10.

29:01 - 29:08
I'm like 10, and then there's the view all you can click, and then it goes to another page and just kind of puts them in a grid.

29:09 - 29:15
So here's carousel with the labels out, so with the labels, then it covers up part of your thumbnail, ...

29:15 - 29:16
Easy to see.

29:16 - 29:21
And this one, if you look at this Rock, you just see a little love it here, the labels out.

29:21 - 29:23
You see it, and then you see the ocean in front.

29:25 - 29:28
So that's Carrousel labels in labels out.

29:30 - 29:34
Featured means your images here are going to be larger.

29:34 - 29:41
So you can just tell, see this image is bigger than this one, so this is a featured carousel.

29:42 - 29:46
They think, and actually, there was talk a while ago.

29:46 - 29:48
Well, that's always at the top, but I don't know.

29:48 - 29:51
If you look at, Uh, I can't remember it was.

29:51 - 30:01
If it was, um, Netflix or Prime video, that now sometimes we're using bigger ones in the middle so they didn't want to limit it that way.

30:03 - 30:12
You can also choose to have your thumbnails displayed in landscape or as posters in portrait.

30:15 - 30:18
And again, this goes back combinations in here.

30:19 - 30:21
You can look through the list of them.

30:22 - 30:24
Now this is the one that's kind of confusing.

30:26 - 30:32
When I first saw this, I said Grid three, OK, so it's going to be a grid, I can either go three across, or for cross.

30:33 - 30:35
No, that's the wrong answer.

30:35 - 30:51
What the Grid three in grid for mean is that their relative sizes, so you can see right here, if you look at the width of this and the width of this one, the grid three, and this is I tested.

30:51 - 30:55
It's like 800 pixel wide, you do get three across and four across.

30:55 - 31:05
But if you have a wider screen, Here's the grid: 3 is 4 Cross, and the grid 4 is 5 across.

31:05 - 31:13
So, really featured grid three and grid for have to do with relative size.

31:13 - 31:21
If the biggest ones are featured, the next bigger ones are Grid three, then the smallest ones would be grid for.

31:23 - 31:35
And, and that's a little tricky, because in my it was my mistake going in with my expectations, like, oh, grid three means is three across, no matter what, as I get bigger, like, I guess the images get bigger or something, but that's not true.

31:36 - 31:36
Right.

31:36 - 31:41
It's just relative size featured Grid three and Grid four.

31:43 - 31:47
And again, I talk about the common configuration.

31:47 - 31:54
And, in fact, Jeff wrote a doc on those and nicely documented.

31:55 - 31:55
Note here.

31:55 - 31:56
Permitted locations.

31:56 - 32:01
You'll actually get an error if you have, if you don't have permitted locations.

32:01 - 32:06
Whereas if you don't specify validates, the page just doesn't show up.

32:06 - 32:09
So Lilah consisting consistency there.

32:14 - 32:35
Again, key doc here, when it comes time, just a real quickly reinforce, we talk about blocks, single block lists, block, tab, block, drop-down block, and the layouts are a combination of the features I listed down below, like carousel labels and labels out grid, featured, pallister.

32:35 - 32:36
Landscape.

32:36 - 32:39
That kind of stuff and you can choose which one to use.

32:43 - 32:46
Give a pregnant pause of silence here.

32:46 - 32:50
So, you can just think through what we've done if you have any questions.

32:55 - 32:57
No, perfect.

33:01 - 33:03
Including non configurable pages.

33:03 - 33:06
Well, this is really straightforward, actually.

33:07 - 33:12
You go in, all of them are non configurable, except the two self ones.

33:13 - 33:15
And you decide what you want.

33:16 - 33:17
And you put it in.

33:17 - 33:18
And.

33:18 - 33:20
Yeah, so that's pretty much it.

33:20 - 33:27
We do have a Doc on that, also, including non configurable.

33:27 - 33:29
So here's another example.

33:29 - 33:31
Settings has three to choose from.

33:32 - 33:32
Right?

33:32 - 33:36
And once you choose that, though, they're not configurable after that.

33:37 - 33:45
And you choose the type there, and here's a table with information about it and how to select it, right?

33:45 - 33:47
So those are straightforward.

33:47 - 33:51
I'm not gonna go through everyone, that's no fun for anybody, especially you guys.

33:51 - 33:52
So I'm not gonna go there.

33:54 - 33:58
All right, a couple of tips and traps, tips.

33:58 - 34:05
When adding a series to a page, it must be first must be first placed in a playlist.

34:05 - 34:06
That took me a little while.

34:06 - 34:10
We were building, working with series, Jeff, and I was like, wait a SEC.

34:10 - 34:17
I don't see where I can add a series, and then I realize you have to put it in playlists first, also, what we tested.

34:17 - 34:21
Don't consecutively number the order places, right?

34:21 - 34:22
And I ran into that.

34:22 - 34:25
I was putting everything at the end, like 100, 101, 102.

34:25 - 34:28
And then if I wanted to put in one in between, I had to re number above.

34:28 - 34:29
So that's no fun.

34:31 - 34:34
So just leave them spaced out my five, or 10, whatever.

34:35 - 34:49
Then the traps, if you have a page that is non visible, is not appearing, or you get an error occur, no kind of a no content available at the moment, First thing to go look at is the rights and scheduling tab.

34:49 - 34:55
Like, is it Mark publish, there's a little checkbox, are the start and end dates valid for the time?

34:55 - 34:59
Do you have devices enabled and you have a permitted location or locations?

35:01 - 35:02
Put those in.

35:02 - 35:02
Yeah.

35:04 - 35:05
Quick review.

35:06 - 35:08
Three types configurable screen.

35:08 - 35:13
That's where we put the videos non configurable, kinda like the system pages.

35:14 - 35:17
The Settings, the Favorites.

35:17 - 35:25
And there's different kinds of you can put them together, like Favorites recently watched the redirects for the web only.

35:26 - 35:32
Also, remember, when you're creating a page, you're going to have a menu item for it and building your configurable screen pages.

35:32 - 35:41
You have blocks, layouts, and playlists, and that my friends wraps it up.

35:42 - 35:57
First question I have any suggestions on configurable versus non configurable or are should we work hard to just avoid the term's somehow?

35:58 - 36:03
And we're really, I'm really looking forward to the new UI is what I'm talking about here.

36:03 - 36:05
We have documents about it, it's done.

36:05 - 36:07
Any suggestions on, on that?

36:07 - 36:08
First of all?
Bob Bailey
36:13 - 36:15
I believe that I would leave the names in.

36:16 - 36:19
You think, not configurable, non configurable, or Yeah.
Bob Bailey
36:19 - 36:20
I mean, I like that.
Bob Bailey
36:20 - 36:24
I mean, at least for right now, right, if that's what they're called, I would use them.
Bob Bailey
36:24 - 36:29
Like, I like the name like system or default pages or something.
Bob Bailey
36:29 - 36:31
You know, I think there's a better name.
Bob Bailey
36:31 - 36:33
But for right now, that's what they're called, I'd leave that in there.

36:34 - 36:36
Going forward, like.
Bob Bailey
36:36 - 36:43
Oh, going forward, I would say, like, audio configurable.
Bob Bailey
36:43 - 36:49
It's either like system pages, or like account page, or something or default.
Bob Bailey
36:49 - 36:50
You know, something like that.
Bob Bailey
36:51 - 36:56
I like system, right, Because it's kinda like it's provided, I think it kind of implies you can't change it.
Bob Bailey
36:57 - 36:58
That's just my opinion.

36:59 - 37:03
Yeah, Any other thoughts, suggestions?

37:07 - 37:13
Any questions about or suggestions about the course, the content.

37:13 - 37:14
Any tips?

37:14 - 37:19
Miguel, anything I did wrong, any other enrichment you can give me.
Miguel Ascanio
37:22 - 37:24
No, I think this is great.
Miguel Ascanio
37:25 - 37:26
This is definitely great.
Miguel Ascanio
37:26 - 37:37
You actually, I mean, it's just great the fact that, that you can modify the blocks and have the page there just a little bit.
Miguel Ascanio
37:39 - 37:43
Not not big enough to still see through the ...
Miguel Ascanio
37:43 - 37:48
Happen and just make the comparison between the blocks and the carousels, that was amazing.
Bob Bailey
37:49 - 37:51
Hmm, a map.

37:52 - 37:52
Yeah.
Bob Bailey
37:52 - 37:54
Have a suggestion.
Bob Bailey
37:54 - 38:07
Um, you, it seemed like when we got into this, the first thing you started with was that redirect page and my life, so my thoughts on that are like, it's only for the web app, right.
Bob Bailey
38:07 - 38:10
So is it really used that much?
Bob Bailey
38:10 - 38:12
And I don't think I would lead with that, right?
Bob Bailey
38:12 - 38:23
Like, like we're talking about application design, so like, this is just me thinking, I'm thinking about, like laying out my videos and, you know, having those little poster images and things like that.
Bob Bailey
38:23 - 38:26
Like I would, I would cover that first.
Bob Bailey
38:26 - 38:31
And either not do or I would do the redirects like later.

38:31 - 38:32
Yeah.

38:32 - 38:40
The only reason, that was a conscious choice, that I did that in, because that was where I was talking about creating the page.

38:41 - 38:44
And I didn't want to go into like a screen by.
Bob Bailey
38:45 - 38:46
Saying, that.

38:46 - 38:49
Begs the question, well, wait, how do I put stuff on the page?

38:49 - 38:56
And I didn't want that, but what I can do is maybe I won't like have favorites showing already, and I could go in and just add favorites.

38:57 - 38:57
No.

38:57 - 39:02
I want a page, though, that no one wants to say, well, how do I put videos on?

39:02 - 39:03
Because that's actually the next section.

39:04 - 39:10
So, yeah, I'll change that, Gotta take notes.
Bob Bailey
39:13 - 39:19
Yeah, my only comment, because like I've invested with the new UI, is, Man, the UI right now.
Bob Bailey
39:19 - 39:20
Does it suck?

39:22 - 39:23
I try.

39:24 - 39:33
I told the designers that, you know, when the when the current customers see the new UI, you can probably expect tears of joy when they see it.

39:33 - 39:35
And I'm not exaggerating.

39:35 - 39:40
I mean, wow, I give all of our current customers credit for braving this thing.

39:40 - 39:49
And just as importantly, all the onboarding people credit for walking people through really, what is a mess?

39:49 - 39:51
I mean, there's no other way to say.
Miguel Ascanio
39:51 - 39:52
About it.
Miguel Ascanio
39:52 - 39:57
I'm the one receiving the heat and then our mothers probably remember.

40:00 - 40:08
You'll, probably, you'll probably have nightmares for years, Miguel, about this old UI, you know?

40:08 - 40:09
It's like, Oh, no.

40:09 - 40:11
Oh, God, I thought, we were still using that UI, you wake up.
Miguel Ascanio
40:14 - 40:18
Really looking forward to it for anyone, but I think it's just going to take a little longer, right.

40:19 - 40:25
Yeah, the first, and this is absolutely internal only, right, no customers can be told this.

40:25 - 40:37
But even the first hints of working things for, for down, for, like even demoing will be, like, late in Q four.

40:37 - 40:38
Right.

40:39 - 40:47
So, and there is a plan for our, some of our design partners to have a beta to look at stuff, but I'm not even sure.

40:47 - 40:49
I don't think that even has a day yet.

40:49 - 40:56
But, like, for internal training, there's talk of being able to show stuff in Q four.

40:57 - 41:00
All right, yeah.
Jeff Doktor
41:01 - 41:03
A quick question about playlists.
Jeff Doktor
41:04 - 41:12
So, um, episodes reside in video cloud play lists are also residing in a video cloud.
Jeff Doktor
41:12 - 41:12
Is that correct?

41:13 - 41:14
Correct.

41:15 - 41:30
You can also playlists are one thing that you can build, either in video cloud, or you can build them in, ah, Beacon UI.
Jeff Doktor
41:31 - 41:31
Bye.

41:34 - 41:35
Go ahead and.
Jeff Doktor
41:35 - 41:37
Import them from video cloud is going to overwrite?

41:38 - 41:50
Yeah, but the thing is, you can create it, for instance, right, I had to create, I had to create a new playlist that, I own, I don't wanna credit, well Yeah, I did create a new playlist.

41:50 - 41:53
When I wanted to add a series to it, right?

41:53 - 41:55
That's something you can't do.
Jeff Doktor
41:55 - 41:55
Right?

41:56 - 42:07
Right, so, the thing with, and that's, this is naming, and this is your vocabulary, so what I think's gonna happen, we're gonna refer to play lists to mean video only.

42:08 - 42:09
And what is current?

42:09 - 42:13
Referred to a playlist in Beacon, or give me called Collections.
Jeff Doktor
42:13 - 42:14
Ok.

42:14 - 42:19
Or, the other thing, we're just going to call them Collections, right, everything, If It's just videos, that's fine.

42:20 - 42:27
The thing with playlists, you create and here, they can contain things other than just, you know, the movies, right?

42:27 - 42:29
Or it pull in.

42:29 - 42:37
So the playlist you pull in from video cloud are automatically listed here.

42:38 - 42:45
But you can also go into here and create playlists that, ah.

42:46 - 42:48
You have things more than just the video.

42:48 - 42:59
So you might want to, first, let's say you want to do a preview of, you know, the burst installment of certain series.

42:59 - 43:06
And you're gonna say, oh, these are the first, you know, watch the first installment of the series, then you can just put like the episodes in, if you wanted.

43:06 - 43:10
So, you could build a playlist of just the episodes and here, if you want.
Jeff Doktor
43:11 - 43:18
Ok, so only if your platelets had the same name as defined in Visual Cloud, then it would be overwritten.

43:19 - 43:20
Well, actually.
Jeff Doktor
43:21 - 43:22
Or is it never.

43:22 - 43:23
Overwritten?

43:23 - 43:24
No, I think it's either overwritten.

43:24 - 43:27
Or it might list both of them.

43:27 - 43:30
Because I did something I honestly, Jaffe, you'll want to test that.

43:31 - 43:36
Because I can't remember if if they both showed up in the list.

43:36 - 43:37
Was like, no, that's interesting.

43:37 - 43:41
So, I, I think if I had to guess.

43:41 - 43:44
I think it's overwritten, but that's what you want to think of.

43:44 - 43:50
We're going to be calling these collections, and collections contain things other than just videos, right.
Jeff Doktor
43:52 - 43:52
Nice.

43:54 - 44:01
And the best thing we ran into that is, we had to create a playlist to add the Series' two.
Jeff Doktor
44:01 - 44:02
Right?

44:02 - 44:02
Right?

44:08 - 44:08
Yeah.

44:11 - 44:20
Miguel had to drop off, but next week, Jeff kinda gave us a little teaser just going to be speaking on.

44:20 - 44:22
Right next week, Jeff, or not.
Jeff Doktor
44:22 - 44:23
Next week, I didn't know.

44:25 - 44:28
Next week is Alberto, right.
Alberto Ladron
44:30 - 44:31
Dad's me!
Alberto Ladron
44:31 - 44:34
I will show you how to publish the Android app.

44:34 - 44:38
Yeah, so next week's Alberto showing us how to publish an Android app.

44:38 - 44:42
Then, I think the following week is Jeff or me, again.

44:42 - 44:43
I'd have to look.

44:43 - 44:44
But.
Jeff Doktor
44:44 - 44:44
Doesn't.

44:44 - 44:45
Matter.
Jeff Doktor
44:45 - 44:47
Once I figure out how playlists work.

44:51 - 44:51
Alright.

44:51 - 45:00
Thanks a lot for your time, folks, and we'll be a week from tomorrow, a week from tomorrow.
