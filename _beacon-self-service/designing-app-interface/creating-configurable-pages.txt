We have three types of pages, which serve VERY different purposes.

First we have configurable pages. In the Brightcove Beacon UI we will see they are called SCREEN pages. We use these pages to layout how viewers should see our video content. In this course, a later video is entirely dedicated to configuring these kind of pages.

Next are non-configurable pages. These pages are like system pages, which provide viewers info about the app, the status of the app and their activities in the app. For instance 
-Downloads
-Settings
-Favorites

are all examples of non-configurable pages.

The last type of page only applies to Brightcove Beacon web apps, and these are redirect pages. These pages redirect to other web pages.

Along the way we will see that the creation process of the pages varies between the three pages types, but there are more similarities than differences.

**Slide 3
This is a quick glimpse of where we are headed. This is a screenshot of the Brightcove Beacon UI to build pages. The gray dropdown displays all the page types. The colorful nested boxes at the bottom of the screenshot are how we will place content on configurable pages.

**Slide 4
Let fill in the Why/What and Hows about configurable pages.

**Slide 5
Before seeing these details, let's go look at some configurable pages in an actual Brightcove Beacon web app.

**Web app
The Home page is showing a featured playlist of videos in a carousel across the top, then using tabs to let users choose what other videos to browse.

The tabs show Florida beaches in another carousel, while the Living Desert Animals are displayed in a grid.

Already we see we have different thumbnail sizes as well as different display layouts.

On the Test Page we see a configurable page that uses a hero image. The background is an uploaded image, then we can choose what and how to display videos.

For the last example, the All Playlists shows two playlists displayed in Grids, but of different size of thumbnails.

**Slide 5
A few details here. Again, we'll soon see that configurable pages are called screen pages in the Brightcove Beacon UI.

The layouts are quite flex, but not quite totally free form, hence the quotes.

And as mentioned, another video goes into details of the options and layouts.

**Slide 6
Before we jump in and start to create a configurable page, a few details about page creation.

We see the path in the UI.

Also, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the pages we create and menu items in the apps.

For each page type, we will see these four tabs on which we will need to supply configuration information.

**Slide 7
Now let's actually build a configurable page. This will be a simple page where we display one video playlist in a carousel.

**UI
In the Brightcove Beacon UI we have a pages tab, and from there we create a new page. 

Before clicking the new page button, we'll want to decide where our new page should be located in the  menu, and get a the Order number for that position. This time lets use 55.

Now click the Add new page button

For Basic data we will provide the System Title, which is the internal name. And we'll use the ConfigDemo. Here we use a name with no spaces just to show that this name can be different than the name that is visible in the actual app.

Then use the order we chose.

We don't need to worry about Friendly URL or Genre Type.

Now select a page type, for this walkthrough we're creating a screen type page.

For the menu item just text is fine.

Now to display some videos.

First the block. We'll choose the single-block since we are displaying just one entity.

For the layout, a carousel landscape labels in is fine.

And finally we'll choose the video content to display and Waves will suffice.

That is about as simple a configurable page as we can get. Watch the later video for all the details on using BLocks/layouts and playlists.

For Textual data enter the Title views will see as a menu Item in the actual Brightcove Beacon app, so Config Demo, with a space.

Non-textual data icons can be uploaded that appear either beside or in place of the text name in the menu. The backgrounds are only needed if using a specific type of screen pages, which will be shown later.

Tags is not functioning now, so we can skip that.

Lastly Rights & Scheduling. Be sure the page is published.

Enter dates when the page can be used.

Indicate the devices on which the page can be viewed.

And lastly handle the locations. Be sure at least one permitted location is supplied.

That's the process.

Let's create the new page.

We want to see it right away, so the cache needs to be cleared.

**Web app
Refresh the page, and there is our new page. And we see the Wave videos displayed as configured.





There are two redirect types, redirect-blank and redirect-self. These are akin to using links in HTML, if you have ever done that. 

The redirect-blank opens a specified URL in a new tab, and the redirect-self opens a specified URL in the same tab.





**Web app
One example is the Favorites page. When you mark a video, series or channel as a favorite it will appear in this list. This is a feature we need to decide we want to offer in our app, and include this non-configurable page in the app. And since it is non-configurable we cannot change the design of the favorites page.

Now let's look at a couple of configurable pages. First is the home page.
