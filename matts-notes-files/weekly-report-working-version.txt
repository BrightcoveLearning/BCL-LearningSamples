Major updates:

Title: Updates to Live Clipping documentation
Description: 3 things added: 
1) availability of streams for clipping and DVR is now 7 days instead of 24 hours; 
2) also, clipping uses Dynamic Delivery ingest profiles and so renditions will differ from those specified in the default profiles for Legacy ingest customers; 
3) Information on the Fast clipping option removed, as that is now the default: a segment-accurate clip is first created, and then replaced by a frame-accurate version as soon as it is available
