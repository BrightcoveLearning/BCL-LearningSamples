1. Start name of doc with gerund ("ing" verb)
2. No numbers in image names
3. Overview steps don't need to be so specific
4. Never a colon after a section name
5. NEVER Beacon, ALWAYS Brightcove Beacon
6. Talking to the customer "you" not "we" (In docs "you", in videos "we")
7. Line 275 no image, but a tag for one
8. "At this point, your event will be created as a container in the Brightcove Beacon app, but to actually start streaming a Live video we will need to set up our transmission in the Video Cloud Live Platform." "will be" or "is"
9. Not sure what I am seeing in the images, has a person who has not created an event seen those before?
10. Step 17 confusing
11. Step 20, what custom fields must be filled in, any? Also, you are in the middle of explaining how to fill out the form and mentioning customer fields seems out of place.
12. Steps are things to do, not descriptions. Step 21 "Setting Streaming to Social Media to Allowed will make the event available for streaming to social media platforms. This can be done once the event has started streaming or by using the Social module." to "Click Allowed if you wish to enable the live event to be streamed to social media platforms"
13. Maybe use stamps to match to the step numbers
14. Step 25 two steps?
15. Step 28 multiple steps?
16. Just copy the steps above to clear the cache. Do you learn everything after doing it once?
17. Step 29 multiple steps?
