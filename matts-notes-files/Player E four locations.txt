The four locations where Player E is used are:

1. Autoplay page layout - This is the page layout that has video automatically start at the top of the page, with thumbnails for other videos below the auto-started video

2. Live TV preview - You will see this instance of Player E when you go to a live TV channel and a preview of what is currently showing on the channel plays

3. EPG Preview - When you go to the EPG, or electronic programmign guide (which you can think of as a TV schedule), you see a small preview of what is currently playing on the selected channel

4. VOD Playback - You can think of this as the "normal" video playback. This player is used when you click on a video you wish to watch and view it playing.

What follows in the rest of this video are quick recordings of each of the four instances of the player in action.
