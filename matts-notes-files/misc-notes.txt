1. Sync with Video.js
2. Open terminal at root of video.js folder
3. git checkout 5.x
4. git pull origin 5.x (probably don't need to do this since you have just synced, but can't hurt)
2. Copy the following into the .jsdoc.json file (replace what is there)
{
  "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
  "markdown": {
    "tags": ["example"]
  },
  "templates": {
      "systemName"            : "Brightcove Player",
      "footer"                : "<strong>this is the footer</strong>",
      "copyright"             :  "2017",
      "includeDate"           : "true",

      "search"                : "true"
  }
}

5. rm -rf node_modules (removes all old node-module info)
6. npm i (fresh install of all required node_modules) **THIS TAKES A MINUTE OR SO TO COMPLETE
7. npm i ink-docstrap (installs the template)
8. jsdoc -t ./node_modules/ink-docstrap/template -r src/js -d docs/api -c .jsdoc.json  **This will get an error, but doesn't seem to matter
9. Open the file docs/api/styles/site.slate.css
  a. Search for .toc-h3
  b. Add to the styles so it appears as follows (add color and font-size)
  #toc .toc-h3 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 1.2em;
    margin-left: 14px;
    margin-right: 7px;
  }
10. open docs/api/index.html (check to be sure it worked)




jsdoc -t ./node_modules/ink-docstrap/template -r src/js -d docs/api -c .jsdoc.json
jsdoc -t ./node_modules/ink-docstrap/template -R docs/bcp-api-front-page.md -r src/js -d docs/api -c .jsdoc.json

Robert, Matt, Bob,
There's been quite a lengthy back-and-forth with our ad server partner,
Videoplaza (now Ooyala), as they've been working to build a custom ad
plugin for the BC Player.
We realized that their initial plugin wasn't working with our playlist
player, an issue also encountered by LiveRail and reported by
recommendation system partners, IRIS and Outbrain, too. After months, David
L jumped in and identified the likely issue point – our contrib-ads plugin
needs to be implemented in the player config vs on the page for it to work
properly with the playlist plugin. David also offered input re: splitting
initialization and configuration through their plugin in the case that a
customer needs to implement on the page, and based on Videoplaza's most
recent response, they have been able to make in-page work.
Given that making ads work with playlist players has been a known issue
affecting multiple partners, are we able to capture this level of detail in
our developer docs?
Thanks in advance,
Meredith

Hi Meredith,
As promised yesterday I would get back to you today with a status on our
progress with the plugin.
Gabriel has been able to make the playlist work with in-page configuration,
so at least this has now been sorted out. Might need a few testings, but it
looks good so far.
We would like to deliver a plugin by end of this week, and it might be that
Gabriel reaches out to you guys if he has any questions.
Regards,
Pernilla
