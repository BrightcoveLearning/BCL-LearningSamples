Onboarding:
1. Robert and I met with Christel about docs/training needed for Beacon Onboarding Tasks - Self Service Tracking. She showed us this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11PVrzJDjUEcoxHIizbkUpIybdCT_trUp7Eb1Kasf6_g/edit?ts=5f0c30e4#gid=0 and asked us to comment in rows I and J what we will do.
2. For the Learning Services staff meeting we discussed this spreadsheet, created a new sheet in which to work (Named Learning Services Copy) and put our info in that.
3. Jeff, Alberto and I expanded on line 20 of the sheet about sessions we could deliver to customers. We put these topics in a new sheet named Trainings. Near the end of our discussion we realized we probably should be list not topics, but tasks. I am going to update the list to tasks and Learning Services will meet to approve.
