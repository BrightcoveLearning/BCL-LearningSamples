Beacon Onboarding/Docs Daily Brief

Carolyn and Robert-

Onboarding:
1. Met with Miguel and next week I am going to assist him (with scripts and video editing) making short videos for what customers have to do in filling in the spreadsheet with video assets. Part of this will be using the app that David LaP built.
2. Was in the initial onboarding call for the latest Beacon customer, Ghana TV, but they did not show up. Miguel rescheduling the meeting for next week.

1. Monetization catch up (David, Han, Andrea, Me)


Docs
1. Doc published and in navigation: Required Images and Their Specifications
2. Alberto and I went back and forth a couple of times with updates on the "Live Event" doc. I will do a final read through in the morning and submit to Jose for review. Thanks for the hard work Alberto!
3. Met with Jeff Doktor as he will be able to squeeze in creating another Beacon doc in the next few days. He will create a "Common Rights & Restrictions" doc. This doc will remove a number of rows from the Onboarding requested doc spreadsheet.
4. Jeff also converted the "Configuring Server-Side Ad Settings" document into our shared doc format since it is needed in Beacon docs and VC docs.  

I've been remiss in not mentioning that Jeff has created a number of Beacon docs in the few spare cycles he has in covering all the other topics for which he is currently responsible. Thanks Jeff!!
