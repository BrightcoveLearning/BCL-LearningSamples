I believe we can remove the notice about 2.19.0 now, the majority of sessions are above this version (75%-96%)
MB: Done


I believe we can remove the Flash notice now, it has been almost a year and there is very little Flash usage now
MB: DOne


The requestMode warning "Note: Initial behavior concerning the timing" seems out of place, I'm not sure it's needed. Was about some specific bug? If nothing else it seems too early in the doc.
MB: Removed (at some time Andrew wanted this put in up front as some customers were loading ads that were never used)


At some point we'll want to update the "implement using players module" video, maybe after the design settles a bit more though.
MB: Going to be a huge task with the time comes to update all the instructions to the new PLAYERS module, but glad to do it for the better interface


The note that starts "Note: You may want to dynamically build the serverURL" the new ability to set the serverURL as a function will replace this. More info later in these notes.
MB: OK


DISCUSS
JSON vs JavaScript notation: I'm not sure we need this section, the JSON notation would work for both the config and JavaScript. I suggest using that format throughout the docs.
MB: Added a note that the JSON would work, but could also use JavaScript as shown. We had earlier complaints about not being consistent with JS vs. JSON notation. We can discuss.


The link to "the ad framework README" can be updated to http://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-ads/integrator/options.html since we now have a specific documentation page just for this.
MB: Done


Remove the adControlBar, adSwf, adTechOrder options, they were just for Flash so they have been removed.
MB: Done


For showVpaid controls it says "They may or may not work depending on the VPAID implementation." which is good, maybe add onto that 'so we suggest testing this feature with your ads before enabling it in production."
MB: Done


"This will prevent slow preroll ads from interrupting after the content video has begun playing. The timeout value will be used." This might be clearer as "This will prevent slow preroll ads from interrupting after the timeout has elapsed and content video has begun playing."
MB: Done


"In some configurations, setting the value of this opton to false will cause flashing of content before preroll ads." let's make this statement even stronger: "Setting this option to false will result in content flash before ads"
MB: Done


Since it's just for flash, we can remove this note: "Note: When using the Flash playback technology, the numRedirects value is not settable, and defaults to Google's default value of 4 permissible redirects."
MB: Done


Remove `loadingSpinner`, it doesn't work and we're going to remove it.
MB: Done


"Note the following when using when NOT using useMediaCuePoints:" not accurate, the `oncue` options if for use with useMediaCuePoints.
MB:  Removed


DISCUSS
"which can happen on a poorly performing site." does this mean speed performance? if so I'm not sure it's right. Does it mean user engagement? Just a bit confused about this part.
MB: This is referring to speed performance


"Note: All requestMode values make ondemand requests immediately." I think this is confusing, not sure it's needed.
MB: Removed


"Note that postrolls are NOT supported when using oncue." this isn't accurate, I suggest we keep the caveats out of this doc since the linked doc has an authoritative list.
MB: Removed


Under requestMode we have subheaders for "Using useMediaCuePoints set to true" and "NOT using useMediaCuePoints": It might be helpful to change the headers to the intended purpose, then put the config details underneith. So they could instead be something like "Use cue points in Video Cloud" and "Use cue points in live stream"
MB: Done


The link to "test the ad tag" under serverUrl does not link to the subsection anymore.
MB: Fixed


Under serverUrl, we can now mention the new feature in IMA 3.0.0 and later where the serverUrl can be a function. The README has updated information we can use here. https://bithub.brightcove.com/videocloud/videojs-ima3#serverurl
MB: Done, used your mediainfo example


For the note that begins "Note: If the IMA3 plugin has already instantiated," this can be replaced by the new serverUrl function feature.
MB: Done


The default value for the timeout setting should be updated to be 4000
MB: Done


The current description for "timeout" is given somewhat from an implementors point of view, I suggest a new description to better suit a customer perspective.

"The maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for ads to play before an ad break is skipped."

Then I think we can cut everything else except the example and the "In internal Brightcove testing..." part, which just needs to be updated to say four seconds.

The Note in green at the bottom is good. The "Ideally, the settings for timeout would be the same in both locations." part isn't quite necessary IMO since it's not really "better" for it to be the same in both places.
MB: All "teimeout" changes done


Under useMediaCuePoints, is "ad" supposed to be in bold?
MB: It is, as in Studio you can have ad cue points or code cue points, added "(as defined in Studio)" after ad


"Enables the use of ad cue points to be used" redundant
MB: Updated


Under vpaidMode: "This option is part of the ad framework" I'm not sure what that means, I think this line can just say "This option is configured as follows"
MB: Done


The note about how vpaidMode only affects HTML5 ads can be removed.
MB: Done


Throughout the doc: Make sure we consistently write serverUrl not serverURL
MB: Done


Ad macros section: "cust_params={mediainfo.ad_keys}" appears out of place
MB: Removed (no idea what that was there for)


"To override a method in JavaScript, you simply place the altered method in your JavaScript for the page or plugin." This could use clarification, it's rather vague.
MB: Since the example of how to override follows, just removing this note


The example for "Custom ad macros" doesn't show you how to do something that you couldn't do with dynamic macros, do we know of any examples of what customers might use this for?
MB: I know someone gave me these examples since I would not have known this, but can't remember who. YOu have any ideas for a better example?


For "player.ima3.adrequest( )" we should mention two things: This is for use with the "ondemand" request mode, and it is not recommended for prerolls because content play play before the adrequest completes, resulting in a flash of content.
MB: Add two bullets as "important points to consider"


Also we should mention the parameter to adrequest is optional and that it uses the configured serverUrl if no parameter is passed.
MB: Done


For "player.ima3.ready()" we should not suggest calling adrequest here, for the reason warned about in the previous section (could result in flash of content). In fact, I'm not sure we should included ima3.ready, I'm not sure of a use case that wouldn't be better handled another way.
MB: I've commented out this section, and we'll see if anyone complains.


"see Google's document on the method." probably should say see Google's documentation for the method
MB: Done


For the "HTML5 settings" section, maybe this section should now be called "Accessing the IMA SDK directly" and do not mention the HTML5 ad tech
MB: Done

For "ima3-ad-error" do not need to note that it's HTML5-only
MB: Done


For the "Re-dispatched events" section, there is a separate notion of redispatching for media events, so maybe to be clear we could call these "IMA3 prefixed" events? Feedback wanted on if that would be clearer
MB: Agree, added to section title


"Playback modes" – this section seems to mostly be concerned with Flash support, I think it can be removed?
MB: Agree, gone


Let's modernize the "Player Ad Libraries" section. We no longer recommend checking `player.ads.state`, so let's mention the cool new public API methods that are available instead. The "Information methods and events" from this page are the ones I think are worth adding here. They are called like this: `player.ads.isInAdMode()`
MB: Added a sampling of method, events and properties. Probably need to discuss if I made good choices. DISCUSS


"The output in the console from the above code is shown here:" the output seems to be missing
MB: Could you check again, I am seeing it


The ad network flow section seems incomplete, maybe images are missing? We don't need the SWF part anymore. Is it called the Network tab in every browser? Should there be an apostrophe after "tools"?
MB: Ad network flow not as interesting now, the only interesting item is you see the VMAP XL, so taking this section out. DISCUSS


"a stylesheet if needed" since this page is just for IMA, I don't think we need to say "if needed"
MB: Fixed (that is standard code I paste in when using a plugin, but made specific for IMA)



"Line 35-38: On player ready, a reference to the player is created. The ellipses is shown to indicate where other code you wish to use should be placed." I'm not sure this is needed: the plugin will work correctly without doing anything extra here.
MB: Changed to this: "Line 35-38: On player <code>ready</code>, a reference to the player is created. The ellipses is shown to indicate where you can place code to add other player behaviors beyond IMA3 plugin setup and configuration."


"Creating an ad tag based on media info" We're going to want to replace this with the new serverUrl function, and Mike is making a new doc to that, so maybe this can be replaced with a link to the new doc?
MB: Removing this section as the example for serverUrl uses mediainfo.


"The expanded debugging information would appear similar to the following." looks like an image is missing?
MB: For some reason many of the images did not load for you, please check again.


"When usign Chrome" – typo
MB: Fixed


"Multiple ended events" we can remove this known issue, the documentation is now clear that the IMA plugin must be initialized before other event listeners are bound
MB: Removed


"Content playing before pre-roll" do we still need this section? it seems like flash of content isn't a issue anymore
MB: Removed


"Click Handling" not sure this is still needed? Seems like flash was the big complication here, for HTML5 the behavior is intuitive
MB: Removed


"Exceptions Generated by Overlay Ads" Chrome 30 is so old, we definitely don't need this note anymore
MB: Removed


"Midrolls and live streams/VMAP live streams" – Earlier in the doc we are clear that only cuepoints can be used for live ads, so not sure this is needed
MB: Removed


"Control bars" this seems like a response to a specific question at some point in the past, not sure it's generally needed?
MB: Removed


"Conflict with gpt_proxy.js" We should explain what this is, maybe there is something we can link to?
MB: Commenting out and will see if anyone complains DISCUSS


"Ads will not autoplay on iOS" maybe link to https://www.brightcove.com/en/blog/2017/09/autoplay also it should say autoplay is restricted on iOS, not unsupported
MB: Updated
