**Manchester City
-Context is king
-Saw steps and backed up by video content "felt I would get help"
-"If I don't get it from the steps I can get help from the video"
-"Feels like a companion"
-Help on Dashboard confusing, didn't see it was for each main page, expecting beginner tasks/common tasks in the list
-Different help for different level of users

**Stadium
-Relevant information right away
-No search bar showing - didn't see link to general docs below
-Both video and steps helpful, both options good for different kind of users
-Don't want to have modal disappear on click outside
-Arrows to show leave to new tab look like logout
-Should box get bigger depending on content?
-100% sticky
-Prefer floating modal on top of app, movable and resizable 
-Add "most popular" functionality, the doc links ordered by most popular
-Like both video and steps
-Want to right click on a doc link and able to open in new tab
-EXTRA valuable to have both video and steps
-Want to jump to step in video
-Learn More in tool tip good
-The Dashboard help should obviously match the main pages
-Support link context sensitive about where you are, take screenshot automatically 
-Demo: Interaction good, the links out to full documentation clear
-Feedback in line, not a separate click

**TN Marketing
-Want the steps to live as doing the How To
-Would want to move, but not necessary, ok to resize but not necessary
-Wants text that says "Open in new tab"
-Question mark should be on top right where help box opens
-Demo: See Back to Top link, and title remains (freeze header)
-Feedback allow comments on anything in the app, not limited to feedback on help window comment

**Telequebec

-Like "What do  you need help with" and solutions
-Like pages marked with external link
-Like breadcrunmbs for navigation
-Like the link to external doc, expects full details there
-Modal interaction, want to open box in new tab/window (use two screens)
-Move or resize? Want to move to see UI ++
-Like related content 
-On dashboard help on left side in the wide menu
-Feedback should be available all the time, not just in help
-Like Getting started link
-Wants search, not sure what Search (Brightcove) Beacon Documentation would do
-Home in modal NOT home in left menu, confusing
-With steps, content stays put
-Guide follow steps, what is highlighted
