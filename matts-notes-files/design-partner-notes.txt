**Manchester City
-Context is king
-Saw steps and backed up by video content "felt I would get help"
-"If I don't get it from the steps I can get help from the video"
-"Feels like a companion"
-Help on Dashboard confusing, didn't see it was for each main page, expecting beginner tasks/common tasks in the list
-Different help for different level of users

**Stadium
-Relevant information right away
-No search bar showing - didn't see link to general docs below
-Both video and steps helpful, both options good for different kind of users
-Don't want to have modal disappear on click outside
-Arrows to show leave to new tab look like logout
-Should box get bigger depending on content?
-100% sticky
-Prefer floating modal on top of app, movable and resizable 
-Add "most popular" functionality, the doc links ordered by most popular
-Like both video and steps
-Want to right click on a doc link and able to open in new tab
-EXTRA valuable to have both video and steps
-Want to jump to step in video
-Learn More in tool tip good
-The Dashboard help should obviously match the main pages
-Support link context sensitive about where you are, take screenshot automatically 
-Demo: Interaction good, the links out to full documentation clear
-Feedback in line, not a separate click

**TN Marketing
-Want the steps to live as doing the How To
-Would want to move, but not necessary, ok to resize but not necessary
-Content look
-Wants text that says "Open in new tab"
-Question mark should be on top right where help box opens
-Demo: See Back to Top link, and title remains (freeze header)
-Feedback allow comments on anything in the app, not limited to feedback on help window comment
