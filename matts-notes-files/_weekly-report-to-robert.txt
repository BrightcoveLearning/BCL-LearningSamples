******

JIRA Highlights Include:
- Found out that some new player plugins have been added and a number of docs needed those added. When looking at the plugin docs I saw they were a mess. Different names for same plugin, old plugins no longer available (two of these), missing plugins, etc. A real mess. Got the docs cleaned up (over 2 days of work). This involved four docs in player-en.  I found we use tables frequently in these plugin docs, and going to do what you said Jeff did, have a table in a shared submodule and include it in multiple docs. Probably be two tables then included in numerous places. Also saw in one of the player plugin doc a note the same table is in one of the API docs, so will link to one of the shared tables (task for next week).
- Worked on "quiet" submodule scripts. Jeff and I tested (successfully), as you did, and think I can now add files in the root to run these for all of us.
- Moved BC Player Engineering Plugin Doc Locations doc from Quiver to Confluence. Turned out I think I was the only one who had this, so now in more accessible area for all of us.

** Week Ending 14 January **

JIRA Highlights Include:
- Draft of Managing Cookie Consent Using OneTrust doc done. Had a 1 hour meetng with Jose, Jim and Andy Cruz (engineer working on this issue)  Friday AM and got good suggestions. Also found out by asking questions no one in BC really knows exactly how this is going to work. Andy was assigned by Jose a number of questions to clarify. This is a long doc (32 screenshots) and took me LOTS of time to keep working in the OneTrust's UI to understand exactly how all the pieces worked.
-New doc (refreshing simple) on how to delete an app user in Beacon Classic.
Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:

- Asked to crete a doc on using OneTrust for Beacon App cookie compliance. Needed to get a login to a OneTrust account, which was surprisingly time consuming. Great help from Andy Cruz in GDL, who seems like a great guy to go to for Beacon help, and finally could login. It will literally take me less time to write the doc than it took me to get access to a trial account.
- Did my security training for the year
- Updated both Beacon Known Issue docs with info on multi-language support

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- STILL working with IT to get CORS enabled on //solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/. Turns out IT owns that and not OPS.

Not hard, did the change then didn't have rights to save the change. :-( Tim not around today it seems, but should have that fixed next week so I can continue with Beacon plugin docs.
