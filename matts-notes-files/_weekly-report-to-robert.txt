Also found out by asking questions no one in BC really knows exactly how this is going to work. Andy was assigned by Jose a number of questions to clarify. This is a long doc (32 screenshots) and took me LOTS of time to keep working in the OneTrust's UI to understand exactly how all the pieces worked.
-New doc (refreshing simple) on how to delete an app user in Beacon Classic.
Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:

- Asked to crete a doc on using OneTrust for Beacon App cookie compliance. Needed to get a login to a OneTrust account, which was surprisingly time consuming. Great help from Andy Cruz in GDL, who seems like a great guy to go to for Beacon help, and finally could login. It will literally take me less time to write the doc than it took me to get access to a trial account.
- Did my security training for the year
- Updated both Beacon Known Issue docs with info on multi-language support

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- STILL working with IT to get CORS enabled on //solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/. Turns out IT owns that and not OPS.

Not hard, did the change then didn't have rights to save the change. :-( Tim not around today it seems, but should have that fixed next week so I can continue with Beacon plugin docs.
