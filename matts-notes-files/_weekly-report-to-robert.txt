	* New doc on login timeouts for Beacon apps (shortest doc I have ever written)
	* Add info on all available Beacon languages to Required Information Beacon doc
	* Add info on Smart TV older model support
- Rolled in what I thought were final changes to cookie consent doc until finding out the UI had changed :-( Not sure the impact on the doc yet.

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- Continued to drive the Beacon Plugins doc project. Setup meeting with Andy with Jeff, Yarianna and I to get techical info from Andy for the last three docs that need to be  written. Last pieces of the project now assigned to Jeff, Yarianna and I. Plan to be done by next Friday.
- A boatload of meetings



** Week Ending 4 February **

** Week Ending 28 January **
- Closed 9 JIRAs, 0 of which was administrivia

JIRA Highlights Include:
- Got the code finalized for the Beacon Plugin side panel and did a doc for that as a template for Jeff and Yarianna to use
- Worked with Andy Cruz on some oddities in the implementation in the Beacon web apps for the module based Beacon Plugin code, but all good now
- Another meeting with Andy Cruz on Cookie Consient doc. BC had planned to give templates to customers, but turns out with OneTrust the idea of importing a template does not exist, so got details on what to add to the cookie consent doc. One part is a bit messy, but will do a video for that.
Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- Writing more code on Beacon Plugins. Looking good here, module implementation looking nicer than I had hoped. 
- A boatload of meetings

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:

- A boatload of meetings



** Week Ending 14 January **
- Closed 2 JIRAs, 0 of which was administrivia

JIRA Highlights Include:
- Draft of Managing Cookie Consent Using OneTrust doc done. Had a 1 hour meetng with Jose, Jim and Andy Cruz (engineer working on this issue)  Friday AM and got good suggestions. Also found out by asking questions no one in BC really knows exactly how this is going to work. Andy was assigned by Jose a number of questions to clarify. This is a long doc (32 screenshots) and took me LOTS of time to keep working in the OneTrust's UI to understand exactly how all the pieces worked.
-New doc (refreshing simple) on how to delete an app user in Beacon Classic.
Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- Had Shantal watch me build the Delete App User doc (and we recorded) so she could see the entire process of building as doc. Took 1 1/2 hours. She said it was helpful. 
- Because of the issue with IT not being able to help me with CORS asked Brian Martinez about the issue and he pointed me to the extension that can control CORS locally. GREAT!!
- A boatload of meetings



** Week Ending 7 January **
- Closed 6 JIRAs, 1 of which was administrivia

JIRA Highlights Include:
- Updated Brightcove Player API docs. Usually this is very quick, but every so often changes must be made to the video.js repo and I have to update a bunch of things on my machine to be able to use JSDoc, as was the case this week.
- Asked to crete a doc on using OneTrust for Beacon App cookie compliance. Needed to get a login to a OneTrust account, which was surprisingly time consuming. Great help from Andy Cruz in GDL, who seems like a great guy to go to for Beacon help, and finally could login. It will literally take me less time to write the doc than it took me to get access to a trial account.
- Did my security training for the year
- Updated both Beacon Known Issue docs with info on multi-language support

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- STILL working with IT to get CORS enabled on //solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/. Turns out IT owns that and not OPS. Finally Tim Grey said he would just give me supervisor rights temporarily to the server so I can make the change. Not hard, did the change then didn't have rights to save the change. :-( Tim not around today it seems, but should have that fixed next week so I can continue with Beacon plugin docs. 
- A boatload of meetings

The Beacon LA doc was basically only a skeleton so counted it as a new doc in the weekly report. There were 5 JIRAs from different folks around that issue, so all now closed.
- Got some nice graphics from Funchal design team, but a little big for our doc format so used some JS and CSS to provide zoom in and out functionality: https://beacon.support.brightcove.com/references/branding-beacon-apps.html#Logos_and_icons
- Moved Add User and Change User Password docs from Beacon Classic to Beacon Private per Jose C's request
