Major accomplishments:
**22 Sep**
1. Got Bob setup for local Drupal development. Will walk other team members though the process when they want to see it.
2. One new code sample created on using buttons to load different plalylists. This was some code I wrote for an attendee of DwBP.
3. Update one code sample to new template.
4. Closed 13 JIRAs

Near Term Goals
1. Get new Player Management docs ready to publish, most notably the docs on new plugin registry. I have a draft of those done, but the release of the functionality was delayed, so waiting for the go ahead to update and publish.
2. Get the process of pushing our changes to local Drupal to platform.sh dev.
3. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.


1. Get something meaningful loaded to the dev platform.sh site. For instance, updates to styles or automatic snapshots.

**15 Sep**
1. Added line to bash script to delete db backups older than 5 days.
2. Updated one code sample to new template.
3. Closed 9 JIRAs


**8 Sep**
1. Got the automated backup of the Drupal database working. The only open issues is to add to the script to remove backups over 5 days old, but need some older backups to do that. Will do next week.
2. Updated 2 videos from the Smart Player to Brightcove Player migration webinar. Not too much time involved as the intros still were good, so changed the content of the videos.
3. Closed 8 JIRAs


**1 Sep**
1. Converted five code samples to new template (trying to do at least one a day)
2. Closed 14 JIRAs

Near Term Goals
1. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.
2. Get us so we have a working copy locally of the Drupal site on which to test.
3. Work on off site backups from out Drupal site. Was hoping Pronovix would give a bit more guidance, but the track I started down with some help from Andrew seems correct.


**25 Aug**
1. Finished draft of Plugin Registry doc, Tom R reviewed and I will roll in changes next week (Tom doesn't want it published until he gives the OK)
2. Four code samples converted. Bit of a slower go than I had hoped.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs

**18 Aug**
1. Revised (and revised, and revised, ...) the code sample template. I think everyone is happy, at least for now. Have template HTML and template GitHub repo created. Instructions in Quiver: Creating a Code Sample
2. New code sample created (when creating the template): https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-sample-play-video-end-playlist
3. Closed 12 JIRAs and got open count below 70!
4. Little or no work  on Drupal admin tasks as code sample template a time sink this week.

**11 Aug**
1. Created a new template for code samples
2. Started work on implementing using CLI commands from our Ubuntu server
3. Closed 10 JIRAs

**4 Aug**
1. Got platform.sh snapshots cron job working from our Ubuntu server (last week's configuration didn't work)
2. Got landing pages built for Brightcove Player Developer Docs and Brightcove Player Code Samples
3. Closed 8 JIRAs
4. Great IM discussion with Andrew about off site backups of Drupal content

**28 Aug**
1. Got the Brightcove Player Developer Landing Page documents entered, and checked against faceted search to be sure all docs in
2. Pressed IT to get us a server, got cron job schedule for snapshots. Also installed tools for SSH with platform.sh CLI.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs, mostly minor issues

**21 July**
1. Updated Playlist API with new methods and events
2. Got automated snapshots working using a cron job from my machine (still waiting for IT solution for cron job)
3. Rewrote code and doc for scroll into view with ads
4. Updated the Customizing Player Appearance doc, changes in volume selectors and removed use of IDs
5. Closed 9 JIRAs


**14 July**
1. Got SourceTree to push changes to the dev platform.sh site (now just need to be able to push meaningful thing there).
2. Had a number of JIRAs wanting me to update the Errors Plugin with new errors, but not all the new errors came from that plugin (for instance, some from Catalog). So I created a new "Brightcove Player Errors Reference" doc: https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-error-reference. This gave me a place to put all the errors and then customers can see details on separate docs.
3. Updated the Errors Plugin doc with recommendations from Pat O about new best practices for customer custom errors.
4. Updated Catalog doc with new errors.
5. When teaching DwBP had a couple of questions that led to good code samples. I have written the code (so I could send to customer) and then created JIRAs to write up the sample using the code (placed in the JIRA comments).
6. Overall closed 18 JIRAs (yea, caught up a bit)
