** Week Ending 9 Nov **
1. Closed 9 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia.
JIRA Work Includes:
2. The great percentage of developer docs and CodePens are now updated! YEA!! Still some of the anonymous URL for //players.brightcove.net exist, and some of the CodePens aren't all on the new standards, but what is left is trivial to what I have done. Jeff was great  and jumped in and did 1/3 of the player samples, which I greatly appreciated.
3. Not reflected in JIRA tickets is the work done on the Player Management video intro script and associated sample.


** Week Ending 2 Nov **
1. Closed 13 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.
JIRA Work Includes:
2. Biggest time investment was updated developer docs according to list in Quiver (too long to list here). I got all the normal docs done, and moved onto the samples. Jeff offered to help with the samples (very happy about that), and we should have those all done by Tuesday.


** Week Ending 26 Oct **
1. Closed 9 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.
JIRA Work Includes:
2. Biggest time investment was the Player Management API last_viewed doc
2. Updated developer docs according to list in Quiver (too long to list here). Made some real progress finally, about 90% done with dev docs. Still all the samples to do, but at least some progress. Made more progress partially because not dealing with <code> and notranslate, as assuming this will be taken care of in GTranslate now.


** Week Ending 19 Oct **
1. Closed 17 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia.
JIRA Work Includes:
2. Updated developer docs according to list in Quiver (too long to list here). Made some real progress finally, about 60% done with dev docs. Still all the samples to do, but at least some progress. Made more progress partially because not dealing with <code> and notranslate, as assuming this will be taken care of in GTranslate now.
3. Updated IMA3 doc to use two ways to implement in Studio, one using Advertising section, and limited to option in UI. Also using plugins, where you can pass options in using JSON.


** Week Ending 12 Oct **
1. Closed 12 JIRAs, 2 of which were administrivia.
2. Taught DwBP, good session.
JIRA Work Includes:
3. Updated docs for new Players UI, focused this week on plugin docs
4. Updated DwBP materials to use player.muted(true) to avoid autoplay issues


** Week Ending 5 Oct ** IN YACHATS
1. Closed 20 JIRAs, 5 of which were administrivia. (Great 4 days, must be the fresh Oregon coast air.)
JIRA Work Includes:
2. Update to the Download Plugin, now works with DD videos and name of download is name of video (spaces removed)
3. Completed doc on customized endscreens. I had code written, but needed to finish the doc around the code.
4. Came up with sample code for Pat O to show how the Studio code generated for responsive, horizontal playlists in an iframe did not really work well. One issue discovered already fixed, he is thinking about how to solve the other issue.


** Week Ending 14 Sep **
1. Closed 5 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia.
2. Chapter markers sample done.


** Week Ending 7 Sep **

2. Only two Brightcove Player docs updated to new standards this week.
3. Not reflected in JIRAs is the Dynamic Endscreens sample 90% done.
4. Not the productive week with Monday off, too many meetings and interruptions.


** Week Ending 31 Aug **
1. Closed 35 (yes, 35!) JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, 4 of which were just deciding not to do the request and 4 consolidation of changes to player developer docs into a single ticket. Still a very good week on the JIRA front. With no Drupal/platform.sh/Pantheon work to do gave my JIRA list a good scrub and got the work done for the "low hanging fruit" mostly.
2. New sample: Get Seeked Time (uses middleware)
3. New doc: Pre-release Player (keeps player always on latest pre-release)
5. Three LONG docs updated to new Developer Doc standards. These updates are taking as long as I thought they would, which is a bad thing.


** Week Ending 24 Aug **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia.
2. Updated DwBP course to use muted(true) so I don't have to battle the no autoplay issue with browsers.
3. Not reflected in JIRA: LOTS of time coding demos for a writing doc on Brightcove Player Loader library. I think I found and bug and Pat O is looking into it.
4. Not reflected in JIRA: Most of one day working on new instructions from Pronovix to create a local instance of the composer based Drupal support site. Did not work as found out some things not all fixed on Pronovix side.
5. Seven docs updated.


** Week Ending 17 Aug **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.
2. Big time sink this week updating the catalog doc. All the methods changed in parameters, functionality, etc. Had to redo examples and screenshots for output.
3. Started updating of docs based on list in Quiver. This is going to be big task. Any chance we could get some contractor money to help with this? Maybe Emily up for some fairly mindless text manipulation.
4. Create a doc on JS Promises I could reference from a few other docs. That seems to be the way the Player engineering team is heading for some methods now.
5. Restructured DRM doc as I have had a couple of requests to make it more match our other plugin docs.


** Week Ending 10 Aug **
1. Closed 6 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia
2. Working with a freelancer from Upwork on search and replace for Drupal 8; progressing well
3. More time working on Pantheon to migrate the site. Finally got to a point where they could no longer help.
4. Gained experience with Pantheon and used a generic Drupal 8 site I created for search and replace tool testing


** Week Ending 3 Aug **
1. Closed 13 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, 9 updating German translations
2. Got a freelancer from Upwork to start on a search and replace for Drupal 8; checked in today and he says he is progressing and has 3-4 days of work left
3. Spent LOTS of time working on Pantheon to migrate the site. Their support has been outstanding and I have uploaded files and DB and they are trying to find out why it is not working. They were supporting me exclusively via chat, but have now created a formal support ticket and will contact me via email. I think this is a worthwhile exercise as I am learning a bunch about Pantheon.


** Week Ending 20 July **
1. Closed 8 JIRAs, 5 of which were administrivia, others moderate/easy solutions.
2. Updated Andrew's "Jump Starts" landing page
3. Got caught up from vacation


** Week Ending 6 July **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, others moderate/easy solutions. No long, tough tasks completed this week.
2. Although not reflected in a JIRA, I figured out where/how the DB backups SHOULD be deleted. The command to clean up those > 5 days old works at the command line, but not from the bash script. I will check with Andrew B the week I get back and ask for some debugging help. All is OK since we have so much disk space (never even remotely close to disk space issues), and now I can manually clean them up until I get the issue fixed.


** Week Ending 29 June **
1. Jump Start v1 finished: https://support.brightcove.com/jumpstart. Still need to go back and use js_beautify to clean up code on pre-roll and outstream examples. Plus I know Andrew is disappointed with the look, so not sure what will happen with that. This was a HUGE time sink this week.
2. Closed 7 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 22 June **
1. Majority of this week working on Andrew's Jump Starts. Great progess with Drupal pages built. I met with Andrew and he a few comments, all of which I have rolled in except the code formatting (as you know).
2. Finished implementing using play() promise in "Show unmute button when no autoplay" doc.
4. Closed 6 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 15 June **

2. Trying to get feedback from Andrew on the Jump Start samples, will hound him next week as I have promised to have 3 done by end of month
3. Mostly done with update to "Show unmute button when no autoplay" to use the play() methods promise. I used to use logic to check browser, but now Chrome sometimes will autoplay and sometimes not based on past user behavior
4. Closed 11 JIRAs, 5 of which were administrivia



** Week Ending 8 June **
1. Updated Developing with Brightcove Player session to account for Chrome's non-autoplay. This included information in the slides and updating student files.
2. Not reflected in JIRAs is substantial time in a "Autoplay and Brightcove Player" doc I am writing. Still working with Pat O on some technical details.

4. Closed 9 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 1 June **
1. Major work done on Andrew's Developer Jump Starts (or whatever he wants to call them). All I need to finish the first one is some advice from you about how to display the dynamically generated code.

5. Continued work on Andrew's quick demos (no JIRA closings on this)
6. First meeting with the "VX teams - internal communication discussion" (As a result of the reorganization of David’s Video Experiences teams there has been discussion about creating a mechanism to allow each group (Applications, Platform, Players) to share their progress, challenges and wins more widely. This small team of interested volunteers will help define this process.)
I volunteered for this, and it may actually reap some benefits for getting us more in the loop for all engineering teams.

3. Started writing code for AMP/Perform and AMP/Perform/OnceUX


**16 Feb**
1. Closed total of 7 JIRAs, major work detailed
2. Updated "Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs" doc to reflect new proxy. Because of simplification of code, doc got substantially smaller, even though I expanded some of the explanations.
3. Glad to get the setup working for local versions of the Drupal support site. I will continue to push to get us to issue pull requests.
4. Not reflected in the JIRAs are that I updated code for 4 of the samples to be sure I understood using the new proxy. Need to roll changes into the sample docs.
5. Got Golf Channel's player configuration down to autostart works on all but iOS and Safari, and those autostart and viewer has to click audio unmute button. Neil Fiedler and customer seem happy. Will turn that into a sample. Surprised no one has wanted that before.

**21 Dec**
1. Closed 10 JIRAs, including 4 sample updates. Counted up and still 9 to go.
**15 Dec**
1. Still working on Andrew's quick pre-roll doc. Thought Kevin Reynolds had a solution, but didn't work out. Will consult Pat O next week, and if no ideas abandon better solution and use Andrew's copy and paste suggestion.
2. Closed 16 JIRAs, including 6 sample updates. Will take stock of number of samples left to update and if within reason try to finish those next week (will recruit Jeff to help if he has open cycles.)

2. Updated 2 videos from the Smart Player to Brightcove Player migration webinar. Not too much time involved as the intros still were good, so changed the content of the videos.
3. Closed 8 JIRAs


**1 Sep**
1. Converted five code samples to new template (trying to do at least one a day)
2. Closed 14 JIRAs

Near Term Goals
1. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.
2. Get us so we have a working copy locally of the Drupal site on which to test.
3. Work on off site backups from out Drupal site. Was hoping Pronovix would give a bit more guidance, but the track I started down with some help from Andrew seems correct.


**25 Aug**
1. Finished draft of Plugin Registry doc, Tom R reviewed and I will roll in changes next week (Tom doesn't want it published until he gives the OK)
2. Four code samples converted. Bit of a slower go than I had hoped.

2. New code sample created (when creating the template): https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-sample-play-video-end-playlist
3. Closed 12 JIRAs and got open count below 70!
4. Little or no work  on Drupal admin tasks as code sample template a time sink this week.

5. Closed 9 JIRAs


**14 July**
1. Got SourceTree to push changes to the dev platform.sh site (now just need to be able to push meaningful thing there).
2. Had a number of JIRAs wanting me to update the Errors Plugin with new errors, but not all the new errors came from that plugin (for instance, some from Catalog). So I created a new "Brightcove Player Errors Reference" doc: https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-error-reference. This gave me a place to put all the errors and then customers can see details on separate docs.
3. Updated the Errors Plugin doc with recommendations from Pat O about new best practices for customer custom errors.
4. Updated Catalog doc with new errors.
5. When teaching DwBP had a couple of questions that led to good code samples. I have written the code (so I could send to customer) and then created JIRAs to write up the sample using the code (placed in the JIRA comments).
6. Overall closed 18 JIRAs (yea, caught up a bit)
