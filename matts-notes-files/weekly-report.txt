1. Sent out documents to PLAY presenters
2.


** 2 March **
1. 4 Administrivia JIRAs
2. 2 JIRAs on AMP, one for Video Cloud and one for non-Video Cloud. Still need to write up the Perform/AMP/OnceUX doc.
3. Delivered the presentation on Do's and Don'ts for PLAY Presentations two times
4. Finished checklist for PLAY presenters
5. Approximately 5 hours working on getting us ready to make changes to our Drupal site, great 1 1/2 hour meeting with Andrew Bradley

** 23 Feb **
1. Closed 6 JIRAs, all administrivia
2. Updated PPT for PLAY presenters on how to create engaging presentations and associated checklist (this was quite time consuming, but happy with it)
3. Started writing code for AMP/Perform and AMP/Perform/OnceUX


**16 Feb**
1. Closed total of 7 JIRAs, major work detailed
2. Updated "Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs" doc to reflect new proxy. Because of simplification of code, doc got substantially smaller, even though I expanded some of the explanations.
3. Glad to get the setup working for local versions of the Drupal support site. I will continue to push to get us to issue pull requests.
4. Not reflected in the JIRAs are that I updated code for 4 of the samples to be sure I understood using the new proxy. Need to roll changes into the sample docs.
5. Got Golf Channel's player configuration down to autostart works on all but iOS and Safari, and those autostart and viewer has to click audio unmute button. Neil Fiedler and customer seem happy. Will turn that into a sample. Surprised no one has wanted that before.

**9 Feb**
1. Closed 16 JIRAs - Outside of administrivia JIRAs, mostly intermediate time/difficulty issues.

**2 Feb**
1. Closed 14 JIRAs
2. Big project finished for the new playlist behavior. Had to update the Playlist API doc, Playlist Plugin doc, changed the name of 'Implementing Playlists Programmatically' to just 'Implementing Playlists' and total rewrite and finally created a Styling Playlists doc. I had forgotten how much has changed since playlists came out and all the docs were basically total rewrites. Glad it is done as it was quite time consuming.
**12 Jan**
1. Closed 9 JIRAs, including 1 sample update, key JIRAs closed
  -Updated Playlist API with new methods & events
  -Updated HLS doc with new debugging facilities
  -New doc on new bcinfo property that holds player metatdata

**5 Jan**
1. Closed 5 JIRAs, including 1 sample update
2. Not reflected in JIRAs:
  a. Nearly finished another sample (floating player)
  b. Working with Matt Neil on HLS debugging features in pre-release
  c. Great discussion with Ilya on how to proceed on next level of advertising doc (recorded). This will be a major time investment writing it up. Most likely starting next week on this.

**26 Jan**
1. Closed 8 JIRAs, administrivia tasks and small updates
2. Bulk of week spent on new playlist functionality. Found one bug in the shuffle() method. LOTS of testing and will updated 3 docs next week and create one new one all around playlist UI plugin update.


**21 Dec**
1. Closed 10 JIRAs, including 4 sample updates. Counted up and still 9 to go.
**15 Dec**
1. Still working on Andrew's quick pre-roll doc. Thought Kevin Reynolds had a solution, but didn't work out. Will consult Pat O next week, and if no ideas abandon better solution and use Andrew's copy and paste suggestion.
2. Closed 16 JIRAs, including 6 sample updates. Will take stock of number of samples left to update and if within reason try to finish those next week (will recruit Jeff to help if he has open cycles.)

**8 Dec**
1. Still working on Andrew's quick pre-roll doc. Still challenging and as of now Mike A and I are both surprised my code not working. Will consult with Pat O again next week.
2. Although JIRA not closed because functionality not yet released, completed a major upgrade to the Playlist API doc. Will publish when functionality in released player.
3. Closed 6 JIRAs.

**1 Dec**
1. Good start on Andrew's quick pre-roll doc. Actually turning out to be rather challenging, but getting good help from Pat O and Mike A.
2. Closed 14 JIRAs

**17 Nov**
1. Got the Drupal near term goals I had been working on for weeks finished. Found how to push local changes to platform.sh.
2. New Player Management docs published (I had them ready to go and Jeff published when I was on vacation as the new version rolled out).
3. Closed 19 JIRAs (total open down to 47, which is great since the last time I did this report I was over 80).


**22 Sep**
1. Got Bob setup for local Drupal development. Will walk other team members though the process when they want to see it.
2. One new code sample created on using buttons to load different plalylists. This was some code I wrote for an attendee of DwBP.

4. Closed 13 JIRAs

1. Added line to bash script to delete db backups older than 5 days.
2. Updated one code sample to new template.
3. Closed 9 JIRAs


**8 Sep**
1. Got the automated backup of the Drupal database working. The only open issues is to add to the script to remove backups over 5 days old, but need some older backups to do that. Will do next week.
2. Updated 2 videos from the Smart Player to Brightcove Player migration webinar. Not too much time involved as the intros still were good, so changed the content of the videos.
3. Closed 8 JIRAs


**1 Sep**
1. Converted five code samples to new template (trying to do at least one a day)
2. Closed 14 JIRAs

Near Term Goals
1. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.
2. Get us so we have a working copy locally of the Drupal site on which to test.
3. Work on off site backups from out Drupal site. Was hoping Pronovix would give a bit more guidance, but the track I started down with some help from Andrew seems correct.


**25 Aug**
1. Finished draft of Plugin Registry doc, Tom R reviewed and I will roll in changes next week (Tom doesn't want it published until he gives the OK)
2. Four code samples converted. Bit of a slower go than I had hoped.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs

**18 Aug**
1. Revised (and revised, and revised, ...) the code sample template. I think everyone is happy, at least for now. Have template HTML and template GitHub repo created. Instructions in Quiver: Creating a Code Sample
2. New code sample created (when creating the template): https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-sample-play-video-end-playlist
3. Closed 12 JIRAs and got open count below 70!
4. Little or no work  on Drupal admin tasks as code sample template a time sink this week.

**11 Aug**
1. Created a new template for code samples
2. Started work on implementing using CLI commands from our Ubuntu server
3. Closed 10 JIRAs

**4 Aug**
1. Got platform.sh snapshots cron job working from our Ubuntu server (last week's configuration didn't work)
2. Got landing pages built for Brightcove Player Developer Docs and Brightcove Player Code Samples
3. Closed 8 JIRAs
4. Great IM discussion with Andrew about off site backups of Drupal content

**28 Aug**
1. Got the Brightcove Player Developer Landing Page documents entered, and checked against faceted search to be sure all docs in
2. Pressed IT to get us a server, got cron job schedule for snapshots. Also installed tools for SSH with platform.sh CLI.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs, mostly minor issues

**21 July**
1. Updated Playlist API with new methods and events
2. Got automated snapshots working using a cron job from my machine (still waiting for IT solution for cron job)
3. Rewrote code and doc for scroll into view with ads
4. Updated the Customizing Player Appearance doc, changes in volume selectors and removed use of IDs
5. Closed 9 JIRAs


**14 July**
1. Got SourceTree to push changes to the dev platform.sh site (now just need to be able to push meaningful thing there).
2. Had a number of JIRAs wanting me to update the Errors Plugin with new errors, but not all the new errors came from that plugin (for instance, some from Catalog). So I created a new "Brightcove Player Errors Reference" doc: https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-error-reference. This gave me a place to put all the errors and then customers can see details on separate docs.
3. Updated the Errors Plugin doc with recommendations from Pat O about new best practices for customer custom errors.
4. Updated Catalog doc with new errors.
5. When teaching DwBP had a couple of questions that led to good code samples. I have written the code (so I could send to customer) and then created JIRAs to write up the sample using the code (placed in the JIRA comments).
6. Overall closed 18 JIRAs (yea, caught up a bit)
