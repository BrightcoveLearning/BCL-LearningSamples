Major accomplishments:
1. Got the Brightcove Player Developer Landing Page documents entered, and checked against faceted search to be sure all docs in
2. Pressed IT to get us a server, got cron job schedule for snapshots. Also installed tools for SSH with platform.sh CLI.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs, mostly minor issues

Near Term Goals
1. Get something meaningful loaded to the dev platform.sh site. For instance, updates to styles or automatic snapshots.
2. Get this backup process running on new site: https://bitbucket.org/snippets/kaypro4/gnB4E.
3. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.

**21 July**
1. Updated Playlist API with new methods and events
2. Got automated snapshots working using a cron job from my machine (still waiting for IT solution for cron job)
3. Rewrote code and doc for scroll into view with ads
4. Updated the Customizing Player Appearance doc, changes in volume selectors and removed use of IDs
5. Closed 9 JIRAs


**14 July**
1. Got SourceTree to push changes to the dev platform.sh site (now just need to be able to push meaningful thing there).
2. Had a number of JIRAs wanting me to update the Errors Plugin with new errors, but not all the new errors came from that plugin (for instance, some from Catalog). So I created a new "Brightcove Player Errors Reference" doc: https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-error-reference. This gave me a place to put all the errors and then customers can see details on separate docs.
3. Updated the Errors Plugin doc with recommendations from Pat O about new best practices for customer custom errors.
4. Updated Catalog doc with new errors.
5. When teaching DwBP had a couple of questions that led to good code samples. I have written the code (so I could send to customer) and then created JIRAs to write up the sample using the code (placed in the JIRA comments).
6. Overall closed 18 JIRAs (yea, caught up a bit)
