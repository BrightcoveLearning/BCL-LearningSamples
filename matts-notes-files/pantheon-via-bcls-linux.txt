// Terminus PATH Issues
Terminus was installed, but the installer was not able to write to your bin dir. To enable the `terminus` command, add this alias to your .bash_profile (Mac) or .bashrc (Linux) file:

alias terminus=/home/VIDMARK.LOCAL/bclsserverworker/vendor/bin/terminus

Or you can enable it by adding the directory the executable file is in to your path:

PATH="/home/VIDMARK.LOCAL/bclsserverworker/vendor/bin:$PATH"
