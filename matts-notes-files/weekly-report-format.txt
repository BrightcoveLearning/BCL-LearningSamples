New docs:

Title: Dynamic Deliver: Change to Sources Returned
Description: Changes to Dynamic Delivery sources - ***NOTE: this was meant to be a transparent change, and for almost all customers was - a very small number of customers who are using DRM and have created custom code around players are affected â€” we know who they are, and this page is meant only for those customers - AMs will direct them to it as needed. This page should not be promoted for general customer consumption, as that will likely create unnecessary concerns and confusion***
