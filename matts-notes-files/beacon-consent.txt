1. Should I always say "Beacon web app"
2. Shouldn't two templates be created, one for GDPR and one for CCPA
3. Who actually implements the scripts, BC or customer
4. One uses the Beacon Classic CMS to associate the script with Beacon
5. Is this true "You will now create another rule, give it the name <strong>Global</strong>, that uses your GDPR template. In this template no regions are defined, so it will be used wherever the other two templates are not used."
