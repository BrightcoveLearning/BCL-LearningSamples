Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- Good progress on two new docs for Brightcove Beacon, both centered around using the Pages option in the UI. Should have them done next week.

FYI: Trying to get Jim Duval to get a Beacon account just for Learning Services. Been a bit of a frustration to see the videos and playlists changing nearly all the time in Video Cloud, as this changes what is available in the Beacon UI.

Work NOT Reflected in JIRAs:
- Sent out email request for use cases pertaining to jobs a customer would need to do. So far only two responses. Not really a huge concern right now as I don't think the Admin Console docs will be a priority for the 31 Oct release as all customers will still be having their hands held for the coming release. From what I understand, next week I will be given directions to focus on docs that help customers prepare for the meeting with a BC representative to configure the Brightcove Beacon Experience.


** Week Ending 27 Sep **
- Closed 3 JIRAs, 2 of which was administrivia

Still some of the anonymous URL for //players.brightcove.net exist, and some of the CodePens aren't all on the new standards, but what is left is trivial to what I have done. Jeff was great  and jumped in and did 1/3 of the player samples, which I greatly appreciated.
3. Not reflected in JIRA tickets is the work done on the Player Management video intro script and associated sample.


** Week Ending 2 Nov **
1. Closed 13 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.

1. Closed 9 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.
JIRA Work Includes:
2. Biggest time investment was the Player Management API last_viewed doc

JIRA Work Includes:
2. Updated developer docs according to list in Quiver (too long to list here). Made some real progress finally, about 60% done with dev docs. Still all the samples to do, but at least some progress. Made more progress partially because not dealing with <code> and notranslate, as assuming this will be taken care of in GTranslate now.
3. Updated IMA3 doc to use two ways to implement in Studio, one using Advertising section, and limited to option in UI. Also using plugins, where you can pass options in using JSON.

3. Completed doc on customized endscreens. I had code written, but needed to finish the doc around the code.
4. Came up with sample code for Pat O to show how the Studio code generated for responsive, horizontal playlists in an iframe did not really work well. One issue discovered already fixed, he is thinking about how to solve the other issue.

2. Chapter markers sample done.

** Week Ending 31 Aug **
1. Closed 35 (yes, 35!) JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, 4 of which were just deciding not to do the request and 4 consolidation of changes to player developer docs into a single ticket. Still a very good week on the JIRA front. With no Drupal/platform.sh/Pantheon work to do gave my JIRA list a good scrub and got the work done for the "low hanging fruit" mostly.
2. New sample: Get Seeked Time (uses middleware)
3. New doc: Pre-release Player (keeps player always on latest pre-release)
5. Three LONG docs updated to new Developer Doc standards. These updates are taking as long as I thought they would, which is a bad thing.


** Week Ending 24 Aug **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia.
2. Updated DwBP course to use muted(true) so I don't have to battle the no autoplay issue with browsers.

4. Not reflected in JIRA: Most of one day working on new instructions from Pronovix to create a local instance of the composer based Drupal support site. Did not work as found out some things not all fixed on Pronovix side.
5. Seven docs updated.


** Week Ending 17 Aug **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia.
2. Big time sink this week updating the catalog doc. All the methods changed in parameters, functionality, etc. Had to redo examples and screenshots for output.
3. Started updating of docs based on list in Quiver. This is going to be big task. Any chance we could get some contractor money to help with this? Maybe Emily up for some fairly mindless text manipulation.
4. Create a doc on JS Promises I could reference from a few other docs. That seems to be the way the Player engineering team is heading for some methods now.
5. Restructured DRM doc as I have had a couple of requests to make it more match our other plugin docs.


** Week Ending 10 Aug **
1. Closed 6 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia
2. Working with a freelancer from Upwork on search and replace for Drupal 8; progressing well

** Week Ending 3 Aug **
1. Closed 13 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, 9 updating German translations
2. Got a freelancer from Upwork to start on a search and replace for Drupal 8; checked in today and he says he is progressing and has 3-4 days of work left
3. Spent LOTS of time working on Pantheon to migrate the site. Their support has been outstanding and I have uploaded files and DB and they are trying to find out why it is not working. They were supporting me exclusively via chat, but have now created a formal support ticket and will contact me via email. I think this is a worthwhile exercise as I am learning a bunch about Pantheon.


** Week Ending 20 July **
1. Closed 8 JIRAs, 5 of which were administrivia, others moderate/easy solutions.
2. Updated Andrew's "Jump Starts" landing page
3. Got caught up from vacation


** Week Ending 6 July **
1. Closed 11 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia, others moderate/easy solutions. No long, tough tasks completed this week.
2. Although not reflected in a JIRA, I figured out where/how the DB backups SHOULD be deleted. The command to clean up those > 5 days old works at the command line, but not from the bash script. I will check with Andrew B the week I get back and ask for some debugging help. All is OK since we have so much disk space (never even remotely close to disk space issues), and now I can manually clean them up until I get the issue fixed.


** Week Ending 29 June **
1. Jump Start v1 finished: https://support.brightcove.com/jumpstart. Still need to go back and use js_beautify to clean up code on pre-roll and outstream examples. Plus I know Andrew is disappointed with the look, so not sure what will happen with that. This was a HUGE time sink this week.
2. Closed 7 JIRAs, 4 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 22 June **
1. Majority of this week working on Andrew's Jump Starts. Great progess with Drupal pages built. I met with Andrew and he a few comments, all of which I have rolled in except the code formatting (as you know).

4. Closed 6 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia

2. Trying to get feedback from Andrew on the Jump Start samples, will hound him next week as I have promised to have 3 done by end of month
3. Mostly done with update to "Show unmute button when no autoplay" to use the play() methods promise. I used to use logic to check browser, but now Chrome sometimes will autoplay and sometimes not based on past user behavior
4. Closed 11 JIRAs, 5 of which were administrivia



** Week Ending 8 June **
1. Updated Developing with Brightcove Player session to account for Chrome's non-autoplay. This included information in the slides and updating student files.
2. Not reflected in JIRAs is substantial time in a "Autoplay and Brightcove Player" doc I am writing. Still working with Pat O on some technical details.

4. Closed 9 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 1 June **

5. Continued work on Andrew's quick demos (no JIRA closings on this)
6. First meeting with the "VX teams - internal communication discussion" (As a result of the reorganization of David’s Video Experiences teams there has been discussion about creating a mechanism to allow each group (Applications, Platform, Players) to share their progress, challenges and wins more widely. This small team of interested volunteers will help define this process.)
I volunteered for this, and it may actually reap some benefits for getting us more in the loop for all engineering teams.
7. Closed 8 JIRAs, 3 of which were administrivia


** Week Ending 11 May **
1. Three PLAY practice sessions, three of those hour long

2. Updated "Learning Guide: Using the REST APIs" doc to reflect new proxy. Because of simplification of code, doc got substantially smaller, even though I expanded some of the explanations.
3. Glad to get the setup working for local versions of the Drupal support site. I will continue to push to get us to issue pull requests.
4. Not reflected in the JIRAs are that I updated code for 4 of the samples to be sure I understood using the new proxy. Need to roll changes into the sample docs.
5. Got Golf Channel's player configuration down to autostart works on all but iOS and Safari, and those autostart and viewer has to click audio unmute button. Neil Fiedler and customer seem happy. Will turn that into a sample. Surprised no one has wanted that before.

2. Big project finished for the new playlist behavior. Had to update the Playlist API doc, Playlist Plugin doc, changed the name of 'Implementing Playlists Programmatically' to just 'Implementing Playlists' and total rewrite and finally created a Styling Playlists doc.

1. Closed 10 JIRAs, including 4 sample updates. Counted up and still 9 to go.
**15 Dec**
1. Still working on Andrew's quick pre-roll doc. Thought Kevin Reynolds had a solution, but didn't work out. Will consult Pat O next week, and if no ideas abandon better solution and use Andrew's copy and paste suggestion.
2. Closed 16 JIRAs, including 6 sample updates. Will take stock of number of samples left to update and if within reason try to finish those next week (will recruit Jeff to help if he has open cycles.)

**8 Dec**

3. Closed 19 JIRAs (total open down to 47, which is great since the last time I did this report I was over 80).


**22 Sep**

2. Updated 2 videos from the Smart Player to Brightcove Player migration webinar. Not too much time involved as the intros still were good, so changed the content of the videos.
3. Closed 8 JIRAs


**1 Sep**
1. Converted five code samples to new template (trying to do at least one a day)
2. Closed 14 JIRAs

1. Keep open JIRAs under 80 either by closing them, or worse comes to worse reassigning.

3. Closed 12 JIRAs and got open count below 70!

1. Created a new template for code samples
2. Started work on implementing using CLI commands from our Ubuntu server
3. Closed 10 JIRAs

**4 Aug**
1. Got platform.sh snapshots cron job working from our Ubuntu server (last week's configuration didn't work)
2. Got landing pages built for Brightcove Player Developer Docs and Brightcove Player Code Samples
3. Closed 8 JIRAs
4. Great IM discussion with Andrew about off site backups of Drupal content

**28 Aug**
1. Got the Brightcove Player Developer Landing Page documents entered, and checked against faceted search to be sure all docs in
2. Pressed IT to get us a server, got cron job schedule for snapshots. Also installed tools for SSH with platform.sh CLI.
3. Closed 10 JIRAs, mostly minor issues

**21 July**
1. Updated Playlist API with new methods and events
2. Got automated snapshots working using a cron job from my machine (still waiting for IT solution for cron job)
3. Rewrote code and doc for scroll into view with ads
4. Updated the Customizing Player Appearance doc, changes in volume selectors and removed use of IDs
5. Closed 9 JIRAs


**14 July**
1. Got SourceTree to push changes to the dev platform.sh site (now just need to be able to push meaningful thing there).
2. Had a number of JIRAs wanting me to update the Errors Plugin with new errors, but not all the new errors came from that plugin (for instance, some from Catalog). So I created a new "Brightcove Player Errors Reference" doc: https://support.brightcove.com/brightcove-player-error-reference. This gave me a place to put all the errors and then customers can see details on separate docs.
3. Updated the Errors Plugin doc with recommendations from Pat O about new best practices for customer custom errors.
4. Updated Catalog doc with new errors.
5. When teaching DwBP had a couple of questions that led to good code samples. I have written the code (so I could send to customer) and then created JIRAs to write up the sample using the code (placed in the JIRA comments).
6. Overall closed 18 JIRAs (yea, caught up a bit)
