2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.510 align:middle line:90%
In this video we'll learn how
to login to and navigate around

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.550 align:middle line:84%
inside of Video Cloud Studio.

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Video Cloud Studio is
a web-based application

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:90%
that we'll use to manage
our entire video workflow.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.336 align:middle line:90%
To access Video Cloud
Studio open a browser

7
00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:19.836 align:middle line:90%
and go to
videocloud.brightcove.com.

8
00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.986 align:middle line:84%

9
00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Enter your email address and
password and click Sign In.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll start over here on the
left with the Account Selector.

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:90%
This displays the current
account you're working with.

12
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:90%
If you have access
to multiple accounts

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
you can use the drop down to
select another Video Cloud

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
account to work with.

15
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Video Cloud Studio is
broken up into modules.

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:90%
The Media module, the
Publishing module,

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Advertising, and Analytics.

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I also have access
to the Live module,

19
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
so that's appearing
here as well.

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:90%
The modules you
have access to are

21
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:90%
based upon your Video Cloud
account and user settings.

22
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Up here on the right you'll
see product updates, the logged

23
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
in user, and this gear
icon provides access

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:90%
to your user profile, account
settings, user management,

25
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.875 align:middle line:84%
and reports.

26
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.672 align:middle line:84%

27
00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Down the right hand margin
you have the ability

28
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.667 align:middle line:90%
to search the documentation and
learn about product updates.

29
00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Remember in an earlier video we
mentioned that typically we'll

30
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.022 align:middle line:90%
put out an update to the
product every month or so,

31
00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
so this is a good way to
actually go in and see

32
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:90%
what's been added to the
product, what's been changed,

33
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
things like that.

34
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:90%
We also have a link here to the
Support forums, the Developer

35
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Center, and a link
to Contact Support.

36
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:90%
To access a module, click
on one of the green buttons

37
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:90%
or select one of the options
from the Navigation header.

38
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%
As you can see, the Media module
is where we upload and manage

39
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
our videos, we can create
playlists, add them to players,

40
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
things like that.

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
The Publishing module's where
you create and style players,

42
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and generate the publishing
code for a player.

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
The Advertising module is
where you control and configure

44
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
your ad policies.

45
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:90%
The Analytics
module's where we can

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
go in and see how
many views are videos

47
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%
are getting, which videos
are popular, where people are

48
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:90%
watching from, those
types of things.

49
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll have videos on those
modules a little bit later.

50
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.398 align:middle line:84%
