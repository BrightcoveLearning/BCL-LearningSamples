				Hi, I'm Karen Guardino, an Account Manager at Brightcove.
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:06.000">
				Today I want to tell you about our new Smart Players that allow you to easily publish video
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:09.000">
				on desktop computers and mobile devices.
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:12.000">
				The consumption of video content on mobile devices
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:15.000">
				is expected to surpass that of desktop devices in the next few years. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:21.000">
				Every publisher wants to make sure their videos can be accessed by site visitors using mobile devices. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:021.000" end="00:00:25.000">
				Delivering video on the mobile web is a challenging technical problem. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:25.000" end="00:00:28.000">
				Not all mobile devices support Flash player, such as the iPad. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:29.000" end="00:00:32.000">
				Brightcove is working hard to eliminate this complexity for our publishers 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:36.000">
				and make sure you can serve videos to your whole audience on both desktop and mobile devices. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:40.000">
				Thanks to Brightcove's Smart Players, 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:42.000">
				you can just continue to publish your videos as you always have. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:44.000">
				The following are smart players that exist today 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:46.000">
				Video Player 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:47.000">
				Chromeless Video Player 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:47.000" end="00:00:49.000">
				Video Player with Logo 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:52.000">
				The best part is that you won't even have to create new players. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.000">
				Just opt in for HTML 5 delivery, and your existing players of these three types 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:01:00.000">
				will become smart players automatically, along with any new players you create later. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:05.000">
				With Brightcove's HTML5 early access release program, 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:05.000" end="00:01:09.000">
				our smart players will deliver your video in Flash or HTML5, 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:09.000" end="00:01:11.000">
				depending on your viewer's device capabilities. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:11.000" end="00:01:14.000">
				This enables you to use a single Brightcove player 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:17.000">
				that can deliver video in Flash or HTML5, 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:17.000" end="00:01:20.000">
				so you don't have to create and manage separate players for each viewer environment 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:25.000">
				and your existing players can automatically load in Flash or HTML5 mode 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:25.000" end="00:01:28.000">
				without any custom work or additional JavaScript on your part. 
			</p>
			<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:31.000">
