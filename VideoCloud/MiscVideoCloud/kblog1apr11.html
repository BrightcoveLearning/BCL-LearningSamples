<p><strong>Tip of the week:</strong> This week, two trancoding tricks. First, while the G2M3 codec is not a supported codec for uploading into Brightcove accounts, we understand that customers would still like to be able to upload these videos for playback through Brightcove players.</p>
<p>The best option to get these files into your account is to download Microsoft Expression Encoder (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/try-it/Default.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/expression/try-it/Default.aspx</a>) and re-encode the file prior to uploading into Brightcove. It will accept the G2M3 codec and convert it to a Brightcove-friendly codec.</p>
<p>Here's another common dilemma: you have some content encoded as FLV, but you'd like to convert it to H.264 so that it's playable on iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad. The best solution&#8212;by far!&#8212;is to re-encode the original source as H.264; this will give you the best quality. However, if you don't have the original raw video to re-encode, Brightcove offers you a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>As you know, our transcoding engine does not transcode FLV videos that you upload, but you can trick the engine into doing it anyway by changing the file extension of the video from .FLV to something our engine does transcode, like .mov</li>
  <li>If you already have FLV videos in your account that you'd like to transode into H.264, and it's a Professional or Enterprise account, you can use Batch Provisioning to request re-transcoding of the FLV videos. See the <a href="http://support.brightcove.com/en/docs/re-encoding-existing-videos">documentation</a> or watch this <a href="http://support.brightcove.com/en/training-videos?id=724842682001">video tutorial</a> to find out how.</li>
</ol>
