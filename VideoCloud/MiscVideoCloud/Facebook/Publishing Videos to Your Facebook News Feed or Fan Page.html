    <p>How to add Brightcove video to a Facebook News Feed.</p>
    <!--break-->
    <p>As a Brightcove publisher, you can increase the visibility of
      your organization and your content by sharing videos in your News
      Feeds on Facebook*.&nbsp; This article will take you through the
      steps of adding videos to your Facebook News Feed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First you will want to create a new player for viral sharing on
      Facebook, so that you can adjust the settings to conform to
      Facebook guidelines. to turn off advertising and track the
      performance separately in your reports. Within the HTML code of
      your site you can configure how the metadata will be passed into
      the News Feed. Full details on Facebook sharing options can be
      found <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.facebook.com/share_partners.php">here</a>.&nbsp;
      Once this is set, a few lines of JavaScript create a button that
      enables users to post one of your videos to their Facebook news
      feed for all of their friends to see.</p>
    <p><img alt="Brightcove Video in your Facebook News Feed"
        src="http://img.brightcove.com/facebook-news-feed.png"
        height="298" width="320"></p>
    <p>I have also created a <a
        href="http://files.brightcove.com/dev/fb_newsfeed.html">demo</a>
      of this and attached the source code with instructions below.</p>
    <h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://files.brightcove.com/fb-newsfeed.zip">Download
          the file</a>, extract it, and open it in a text editor.</li>
      <li>Edit the meta tags at top of the HTML page.</li>
      <li>Get the JavaScript publishing code for the Brightcove player
        you want to use from your account and replace the demo
        Brightcove player.</li>
      <li>Edit "image_src" and "video_src" within the Facebook button
        code to reference your image and the video player that you want
        to be posted in the News Feed. Retain the format of 'video_src'
        url and add your publisher ID, player ID, and video IDs.</li>
    </ol>
