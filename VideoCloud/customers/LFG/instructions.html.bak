    <h1>Full-window all-purpose player</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>You can use the standard Chromeless Video Player for this, or duplicate it if you want a player that's used only for this purpose</li>
      <li>Create an HTML page for this player. You can put other things on the page if you like, but put the player in a &lt;div&gt; tag, like this:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>&lt;div class="player-block"&gt;<br>  &lt;!-- put the player publishing code here --&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <ol start="3">
      
      <li>Get the player publishing code by going to Media Module, selecting a default video for the player, and using the Quick Publish feature to get the <span
          style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Website</span> code.</li>
      <li>In your HTML page, also include this CSS code:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>&lt;style&gt;
  .player-block {
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;<br>     /* the line below is for 16:9 videos; if you have 4:3 videos, it would be padding-bottom: 25%; */<br>    &nbsp;padding-bottom: 56.25%;
   }
   .BrightCoveExperience {
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;
   }<br>&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
    <ol start="5">
      <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Put this page up somewhere - if you like, it can be "hidden," meaning that you don't have links to it anywhere else - but you need the URL<br>
        </span></li>
      <li><span style=" font-family: monospace;">Now go to the Publishing Module in Video Cloud Studio, select your player, and click Settings to edit the player settings</span></li>
      <li><span style="  font-family: monospace;">In the player settings, check the box for Host on your URL, and enter the URL for the page created above</span></li>
      <li><span style="   font-family: monospace;">To share any video on this page, go to the Media Module, select the video, select this player in the Quick Publish tool, and copy the URL to send<br>
        </span></li>
    </ol>
