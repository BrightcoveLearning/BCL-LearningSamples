    <h1>Full-window all-purpose player</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>You can use the standard Chromeless Video Player for this, or duplicate it if you want a player that's used only for this purpose</li>
      <li>Create an HTML page for this player. You can put other things on the page if you like, but put the player in a &lt;div&gt; tag, like this:</li>
    </ol>
<pre>&lt;div class="player-block"&gt;<br/>
  &lt;!-- put the player publishing code here --&gt;<br/>
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Get the player publishing code by going to Media Module, selecting a default video for the player, and using the Quick Publish feature to get the <strong><em>Website</em></strong> code.</li>
      <li>Paste the code inside the div tag, and remove or comment out the params for <em>width</em> and <em>height</em></li>
      <li>In your HTML page, also include this CSS code:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>&lt;style&gt;
  .player-block {
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;<br>     /* the line below is for 16:9 videos; if you have 4:3 videos, it would be padding-bottom: 25%; */<br>    &nbsp;padding-bottom: 56.25%;
   }
   .BrightCoveExperience {
     width: 100%;
     height: 100%;
   }<br>&lt;/style&gt;</pre>
    <ol start="6">
      <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Put this page up somewhere - if you like, it can be "hidden," meaning that you don't have links to it anywhere else - but you need the URL<br>
        </span></li>
      <li><span style=" font-family: monospace;">Now go to the Publishing Module in Video Cloud Studio, select your player, and click Settings to edit the player settings</span></li>
      <li><span style="  font-family: monospace;">In the player settings, check the box for Host on your URL, and enter the URL for the page created above</span></li>
      <li><span style="   font-family: monospace;">To share any video on this page, go to the Media Module, select the video, select this player in the Quick Publish tool, and copy the URL to send<br>
        </span></li>
      <li>I'm attaching a simple sample HTML file for the page (with my own player and video, of course)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Upload application</h2>
    <p>There's a sample app for this here: <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/media/samples/create_video.html">http://docs.brightcove.com/en/media/samples/create_video.html</a></p>
    <p>A couple of notes on this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I did it all in JavaScript for demo purposes - for production it is risky to expose the write token for your account this way, as it can be use to modify and delete videos in your account by someone who knows what they are doing. It is better to do the processing on the server side, in Java, PHP, or whatever language is available.</li>
        <li>I included lots of metadata - the description, schedule dates, etc., but you could easily limit this to adding the tags you want.</li>
      </ul>
